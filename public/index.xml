      <description>if you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with what &amp;ldquo;mashing&amp;rdquo; is, i&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;mashing&amp;rdquo; is when there is a way to reach a logical, correct solution, but instead of doing that, you try a thing that probably isn&amp;rsquo;t going to work and is mostly a guess until you either give up or it miraculously works.&#xA;in the context of fighting games, when you get knocked down to the ground, you have to respond to a multitude of possible attacks from the opponent: overhead?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;learning the ropes&amp;rdquo; is very much mentally associated in my brain with &amp;ldquo;day 2&amp;rdquo;. why? in swords and sandals II: emperor&amp;rsquo;s reign, every day has a title associated with it. day 1 is &amp;ldquo;glorious freedom&amp;rdquo;. day 2 is &amp;ldquo;learning the ropes.&amp;rdquo; so, this is today&amp;rsquo;s title.&#xA;i mentioned last time that i wanted to at least roughly jot down the steps it took to get this webserver up and running, so i&amp;rsquo;ll use this time to recall them.</description>

      <description>the title of today&amp;rsquo;s post, the very first one, is from futurama, a show about an average dude named Fry who gets cryogenically frozen in the year 2000 and wakes up in the year 3000 to earth being an interstellar civilization. following his job as a pizza delivery boy in the past, he becomes a spaceship delivery boy in the future, hence the name &amp;ldquo;space pilot 3000&amp;rdquo;. i always liked the name, it just sounds neat.</description>
