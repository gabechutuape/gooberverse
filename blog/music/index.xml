this was me recently after i somehow avoided
the entirety of &amp;ldquo;brat summer&amp;rdquo;, featuring charli xcx&amp;rsquo;s
album &amp;ldquo;brat&amp;rdquo;, which debuted to the warm reception
of many twitter users and club-goers alike.
perhaps the most popular track, &amp;ldquo;360&amp;rdquo;, ended up
in my lap after i saw a isco elysium-style edit it
featuring the main character performing a 360 spinning back kick.

i went today to the Victoria Theater to see
&amp;ldquo;Mass of the Fermenting Dregs&amp;rdquo;,
an indie japanese rock band touring the states.
i was in a party of 3, the other two of which
are one friend who is obsessed with the band
and the other who just really likes going to live shows.

featuring songs that i think fit well in a night-time setting.
when i say night-time setting, i envision the glow of an LED monitor
on tired eyes, illuminating an otherwise wholly enveloped dark room,
the owner of such eyes acknowledging that while everyone sleeps, he alone is awake. or perhaps the constant frequency of overhead freeway lights
washing over a sedan as it makes its hour-long journey home at 11:58PM,</description></item><item><title>logic's new album</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/logics-new-album/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/logics-new-album/</guid><description>when i was in high school, i used to listen to Logic.
(and also for a bit in college)
my two favorite albums of his were Under Pressure and The Incredible True Story,
his freshman and sophomore albums that hearken me back to the days
of driving my friends to off-campus lunch in high school, bumping &amp;ldquo;Stainless&amp;rdquo; in the car.
after he released the Everybody album to divisive reviews,
he underwent an extremely corny arc where all his music just&amp;hellip; wasn&amp;rsquo;t hitting the same.</description></item><item><title>awolnation wasn't the worst</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/awolnation-wasnt-the-worst/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/awolnation-wasnt-the-worst/</guid><description>i don&amp;rsquo;t know what public opinion is on awolnation,
but i&amp;rsquo;d like to say i actually like their music.
undoubtedly their most famous track is &amp;ldquo;Sail&amp;rdquo; which terrorized
the internet and memes for the better part of a year around 2011.
following their success with &amp;ldquo;Sail&amp;rdquo;, they received deals from Valve
to make music packs for some of their games, like CS:GO and Dota 2.
in 2018, they released &amp;ldquo;Here Come the Runts&amp;rdquo;, which featured</description></item><item><title>now listening to</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/now-listening-to/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/now-listening-to/</guid><description>what kind of music do you listen to?
right now i&amp;rsquo;m bumping a city pop playlist.
city pop is a term for Japanese pop music from the 80s
that usually takes a soft-rock/boogie vibe with nice funk vocals.
otherwise i have some songs in a loose playlist that are just
fun to sing in the car or are catchy to me in this moment.
i can&amp;rsquo;t tell if i&amp;rsquo;m good or bad at making playlists for the ages,</description></item><item><title>the joy of finding new music</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/today/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/today/</guid><description>you know the feeling of finding a good song?
