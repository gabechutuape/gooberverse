as an asian person, i felt an obligation
culturally to learn about the phenomenon
of kpop. after all, if i was into it, i would
probably be cool. and being cool is a great
primary motivator for someone like me.
i got into it at first with recommendations
from a friend to try &amp;ldquo;Stray Kids&amp;rdquo;. well,
actually now that i think about it, &amp;ldquo;Stray Kids&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>touhou bossa nova has a place in this world</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/touhou-bossa-nova-has-a-place-in-this-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/touhou-bossa-nova-has-a-place-in-this-world/</guid><description>have you ever listened to a touhou bossa nova mix?
touhou is a japanese bullet hell video game series
with a shitload of lore (?) and a bunch of characters.
it apparently also has jazz and bossa nova music.
if i could describe touhou in one word, it would be &amp;ldquo;eternal&amp;rdquo;.
touhou has felt like it&amp;rsquo;s had its own corner of the internet
since i remember logging on to 4chan the first time in 2010.</description></item><item><title>beatswitches</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/beatswitches/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/beatswitches/</guid><description>beatswitches in a track can easily be legendary.
nights by frank ocean? a legendary beatswitch.
what triggered this thought? i was listening to
the dandadan opening, which features
an almost ethereal beatswitch every other 1/4th of the song.
another famous beatswitch was Logic&amp;rsquo;s Under Pressure,
where he switches perspectives from his hustling self
to the perspective of a little sister writing a plea for help
to their brother, and a father wishing to reconnect with his son.</description></item><item><title>ksi's thick of it</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/ksis-thick-of-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/ksis-thick-of-it/</guid><description>have you heard ksi&amp;rsquo;s new song?
people are clowning on it on the internet daily.
feedback like, &amp;ldquo;it sounds corny&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;KSI sucks&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;the song is trash&amp;rdquo;, etc etc.
well let me be the first to tell you:
it&amp;rsquo;s true. the song is corny. it sounds like
it came out in 2018 for the summer season.
which is not to say it sounds literally terrible
it just.. sounds quite generic. and also</description></item><item><title>a song you can't name</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/a-song-you-cant-name/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/a-song-you-cant-name/</guid><description>on the tip of your tongue..
we&amp;rsquo;ve all been there, where you have
an earworm in your brain but you can&amp;rsquo;t
place the name of the song.
today, i had that with this track from
final fantasy xiv, which has very &amp;ldquo;the end&amp;rdquo;
vibes to it. but it sounds a lot like something
that could easily be in ff7, or even an anime.
luckily my friend recognized it when i hummed it</description></item><item><title>the joy of finding new music</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-joy-of-finding-new-music/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-joy-of-finding-new-music/</guid><description>you know the feeling of finding a good song?
this was me recently after i somehow avoided
the entirety of &amp;ldquo;brat summer&amp;rdquo;, featuring charli xcx&amp;rsquo;s
album &amp;ldquo;brat&amp;rdquo;, which debuted to the warm reception
of many twitter users and club-goers alike.
perhaps the most popular track, &amp;ldquo;360&amp;rdquo;, ended up
in my lap after i saw a isco elysium-style edit it
featuring the main character performing a 360 spinning back kick.
i&amp;rsquo;ve been spamming this song while playing space marine 2</description></item><item><title>live concert experience</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/live-concert-experience/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/live-concert-experience/</guid><description>have you ever been to a live concert show?
i went today to the Victoria Theater to see
&amp;ldquo;Mass of the Fermenting Dregs&amp;rdquo;,
an indie japanese rock band touring the states.
i was in a party of 3, the other two of which
are one friend who is obsessed with the band
and the other who just really likes going to live shows.
