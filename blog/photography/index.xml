it feels a little weird, right?
we&amp;rsquo;re very used to going with at least one other person,
or at least i do that a lot of the time.
i recently went to mitsuwa in Arlington Heights
to get some pictures on my rental Fujifilm X-T30II.

do you think of people? or of sounds? or of feelings? or of sights?
a familiar sight is my mom&amp;rsquo;s teacup, usually found sitting on the dining table or the living room table.
(and occasionally the kitchen countertop when she forgets to bring it upstairs.)
my mom&amp;rsquo;s preferred mug. usually contains green tea.</description></item><item><title>pictures and photography 2</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/pictures-and-photography-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/pictures-and-photography-2/</guid><description>remember how last time i talked about photography
i mentioned i may one day get a camera of my own?
well, it happened.
sanukiseimen udon, at mitsuwa arlington heights. i got a minolta x-570, a camera made in 1983
as a low-cost alternative to the x-700.
it is revered for its strictly manual capabilities
and its good-for-its-time functioning lightmeter.</description></item><item><title>pictures and photography</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/pictures-and-photography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/pictures-and-photography/</guid><description>we all go on random youtube binges right?
the ones where it&amp;rsquo;s a topic that you&amp;rsquo;ve briefly touched in the past,
and you never got fully into but seemed interesting at the time.
one of those for me is professional photography.
as someone who has done a fairly minimal amount of research into the
more detailed parts of the workflow of it all,
f numbers, apertures, shooting speeds, lens sizes, digital and film,</description></item></channel></rss>
