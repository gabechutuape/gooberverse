didn&amp;rsquo;t have to be in university,
we don&amp;rsquo;t discriminate against education levels
around these parts.
but for me, the standout ones DID happen
to be when i was at university, because man
those exams had hands and i was caught lacking.
but pass or fail, with exams, the best part is:
when they&amp;rsquo;re done, they&amp;rsquo;re done. once you turn them in,
it&amp;rsquo;s out of your hands and you can stop worrying.</description></item><item><title>humans and skinwalkers</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/humans-and-skinwalkers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/humans-and-skinwalkers/</guid><description>an unfortunate consequence of protagonist syndrome
is that people will view other people as NPCs.
alternate term for npcs is skinwalkers.
people who you communicate with as a human
and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like you&amp;rsquo;re talking to them
or that they&amp;rsquo;re consuming any information
that you&amp;rsquo;re relaying to them in that moment.
i&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a bunch of FFXIV ultimate raids
and partying with random people to do the game&amp;rsquo;s</description></item><item><title>the meaning of grimy</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-meaning-of-grimy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-meaning-of-grimy/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;grimy&amp;rdquo; feels like it sounds.
when someone does something underhanded,
with clearly identifiable ulterior motive,
(but we&amp;rsquo;re not talking anything criminal here),
that dude is being grimy.
slimy is a similar word that somehow
also sounds similar to grimy.
lying about something or making
a bad faith argument? absolutely
grimy behavior.
lying about how far you&amp;rsquo;ve made it in a
FFXIV raid? grimy behavior. but sometimes
you gotta do it because everyone else is</description></item><item><title>extreme focus (ultimate raiding)</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/extreme-focus-ultimate-raiding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/extreme-focus-ultimate-raiding/</guid><description>have you ever focused so hard?
so hard that you have to actively think
about replenishing your sucrose stores
inside your brain so that you can
continue doing what you&amp;rsquo;re focusing?
i&amp;rsquo;m currently doing a challenging raid
in FFXIV that requires constant focus
and i went for 5 hours today of just
straight mechanics after mechanics..
but it will all be worth it!
thanks for reading today&amp;rsquo;s post.
yes.. this is where my focus should be.</description></item><item><title>theoretical and practical</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/theoretical-and-practical/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/theoretical-and-practical/</guid><description>in the world of Warhammer 40k,
there is a man called Roboute Guilliman.
(pronounced roo-boot, gill-ih-man)
Guilliman is a master strategist and leader of men,
revered for his universal pragmatism and resourcefulness.
one of his famed thought practices is the
&amp;ldquo;theoretical, practical&amp;rdquo; approach to problem-solving.
the process goes like this: state a problem you have
as the &amp;ldquo;theoretical&amp;rdquo;. then, name states of reality or
solutions pertaining to the problem that you can accomplish.</description></item><item><title>a song you can't name</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/a-song-you-cant-name/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/a-song-you-cant-name/</guid><description>on the tip of your tongue..
we&amp;rsquo;ve all been there, where you have
an earworm in your brain but you can&amp;rsquo;t
place the name of the song.
today, i had that with this track from
final fantasy xiv, which has very &amp;ldquo;the end&amp;rdquo;
vibes to it. but it sounds a lot like something
that could easily be in ff7, or even an anime.
luckily my friend recognized it when i hummed it</description></item><item><title>the location of the pant cuff</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-location-of-the-pant-cuff/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-location-of-the-pant-cuff/</guid><description>have you ever thought about pants?
specifically, how you like your pants to fit.
some people like them more high-waisted,
others like them when they&amp;rsquo;re baggier.
some like darker colors and rougher fabrics,
others prefer lighter colors and lightweight fabrics.
my personally perfect pant is this:
a pure black denim that allows me to sit it
just beneath my navel, while the exact cuff
of the pant reaches such that you can see</description></item></channel></rss>
