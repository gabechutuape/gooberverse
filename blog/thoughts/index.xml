they&amp;rsquo;re a way to call someone in a game. their username.
or their character name. or their display name.
my first username that i can remember was Project_Star,
back on a korean mmo that i forget the name of (not MapleStory).
i used a lot of different names like Project_Silver, Project_WAR,
and in the present day, ProjectG (for gabe).
in-game names are fun because they&amp;rsquo;re what people choose most of the time</description></item><item><title>what about culver's?</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-about-culvers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-about-culvers/</guid><description>you wanna go to culver&amp;rsquo;s?
Culver&amp;rsquo;s is a midwestern classic.
it features their signature &amp;ldquo;butterburgers&amp;rdquo;,
which are burgers with their buns buttered,
as well as cheese curds on the side.
if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough for you, they also make
pretty good desserts in the realm of milkshakes and concrete mixers.
there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of decadent options available.
for a while, i had a slight apprehension to culver&amp;rsquo;s,
since it&amp;rsquo;s so greasy and whatnot.</description></item><item><title>car air fresheners</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/car-air-fresheners/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/car-air-fresheners/</guid><description>do you have an air freshener in your car?
some people like the trees. &amp;ldquo;Black Ice&amp;rdquo;, apparently,
is the scent of choice. supposed to be like new car smell.
new car smell is apparently due to leather outgassing,
by the way. all the plastics and adhesives inside the car
expand from heat and release a &amp;ldquo;smell&amp;rdquo;. which some people like!
i kinda liked new car smell, but i wasn&amp;rsquo;t the biggest fan.</description></item><item><title>taking out the trash</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/taking-out-the-trash/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/taking-out-the-trash/</guid><description>is today trash day for you?
in our neighborhood, trash day is monday.
so, taking out the trash gets added to my sunday list of chores.
it&amp;rsquo;s not a particularly long list, usually just laundry and trash.
for a long time taking out the trash was not habitual,
and i would often forget to do it on sundays.
when i was on campus, this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really matter, since
the trash just goes to the bin behind the apartment.</description></item><item><title>changing seasons</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/changing-seasons/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/changing-seasons/</guid><description>when September rolls around is when i start thinking that seasons are changing.
persona 3 has a great track called changing of the seasons that i think of this time of year (although in-game, this track doesn&amp;rsquo;t play around September.)
my 2nd favorite season is probably fall, next to winter. the red and orange colored leaves are just amazing to look at. makes you feel young when you drive underneath trees like that.</description></item><item><title>saturday nights</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/saturday-nights/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/saturday-nights/</guid><description>it&amp;rsquo;s saturday night.
the boys are in discord, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to game.
what ensues is a tale of camaraderie, triumph, loss, despair, battle,
but ultimately, through it all, the best vibes of all time.
i invite you to listen to saturday nights by inoha,
in the commemoration of awesome saturday nights.
we don&amp;rsquo;t have that many, people!
thanks for reading today&amp;rsquo;s post.
let&amp;rsquo;s get it started.</description></item><item><title>monthly calendars</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/monthly-calendars/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/monthly-calendars/</guid><description>i used to not have any physical calendars because i felt i wasn&amp;rsquo;t organized enough to make use of a calendar.
then, at some point, i decided some calendars just look quite neat and they offer value on their own by acting as nice decoration.
helenpeanut&amp;rsquo;s 2024 calendar featuring Haikyuu!! characters. i have this one by helenpeanut featuring Haikyuu!! characters, which is an anime about highschoolers in Japan playing volleyball and trying to be the best in the country.</description></item></channel></rss>
