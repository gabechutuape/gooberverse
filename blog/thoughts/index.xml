you&amp;rsquo;ve definitely had bad days before.
but when &amp;ldquo;bad days&amp;rdquo; strike on days when you
need to perform to a certain level that is expected,
what can you do to mitigate the effects of the curse?
i like to just pretend it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist,
but the thing with superstitions is that they pervade
the conscious realm and kinda seep around in the
beneath-layer of your mind&amp;hellip; its imperceptibility</description></item><item><title>the joe rogan experience</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-joe-rogan-experience/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-joe-rogan-experience/</guid><description>truth be told, i&amp;rsquo;ve never really
exercised my political muscles at all.
i think for a large percentage of young people,
it&amp;rsquo;s easier to just kind of not think about
this type of stuff when people are always like
&amp;ldquo;server rules are no politics.&amp;rdquo;
but if you go looking in the right places,
you find the discussion channels for it,
and that&amp;rsquo;s where the real grimy shit happens.

back in high school and under days,
chewing gum was the absolute item to have.
you could trade it for anything.
either that, or you would take a piece out
and then the person next to you would be like
&amp;ldquo;hey man, could i have one? :^)&amp;rdquo; and then
it&amp;rsquo;s like, well, i&amp;rsquo;m gaining social credit
by giving you this piece of gum but also</description></item><item><title>jollibee fried chicken</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/jollibee-fried-chicken/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/jollibee-fried-chicken/</guid><description>have you ever had Jollibee?
Jollibee is a filipino fast food chain known
for their fried chicken, peach mango pies,
and their spaghetti served with hotdogs
(as is the custom in the Philippines.).
i used to not be super hyped on Jollibee;
i&amp;rsquo;ve had it a few times in New York and
a few more times while in the actual motherland.
but i recently found out that one of my friends'</description></item><item><title>effort in results out</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/effort-in-results-out/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/effort-in-results-out/</guid><description>it can be an important thing to recognize
when your effort into a thing does not necessarily
equal the results you want out of it.
there is absolutely a point of diminishing returns
on many things in the real world, (which is not to
speak about video game logic where that might not be the case.)
i&amp;rsquo;m banging my head against the wall joining random parties

on daylight savings time as a concept.
most people i know are like, &amp;ldquo;can we just
stick to one time? and just not fuck with it?&amp;rdquo;
i&amp;rsquo;ll admit i&amp;rsquo;ve never looked into the actual
functional purpose of daylight savings time
and instead assumed it was an antiquated thing
that probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any place maintaining
its own existence in the year of our lord 2024.</description></item><item><title>students and teachers</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/students-and-teachers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/students-and-teachers/</guid><description>i was thinking about this the other day,
you ever consider the education system
from the perspective of the teacher and
not as the student (as many of us were at one point)?
when i was a kid in elementary and middle school,
i always thought teachers had it in for me
or that they were singling me out for being
relatively innocuous.
turns out i was being an active obstruction</description></item></channel></rss>
