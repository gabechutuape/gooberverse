or on new years eve only?
maybe both?
it&amp;rsquo;s a bit confusing to me.
we called off meeting for raid today
because people would be preparing stuff for new year&amp;rsquo;s eve,
which kinda makes sense. there&amp;rsquo;s stuff to do
specifically at midnight of course.
but the rest of the day&amp;hellip;?
what else could possibly be going on?
you&amp;rsquo;re not going to work tomorrow,
that&amp;rsquo;s for sure.</description></item><item><title>switching out blankets</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/switching-out-blankets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/switching-out-blankets/</guid><description>how often do you fundamentally change
the bedding that you use to sleep on?
when i say &amp;ldquo;fundamentally change&amp;rdquo;,
i don&amp;rsquo;t mean washing your sheets.
i mean buying new ones or rotating
old ones back into the mix.
i&amp;rsquo;ve been using a bearaby weighted blanket
for the better part of 2024 now, and it
was great when it started out. but the ventilation
offered by the weaving of it is actually proving</description></item><item><title>the pain of awkwardness</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-pain-of-awkwardness/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-pain-of-awkwardness/</guid><description>sometimes, when a joke bombs,
or when you just don&amp;rsquo;t know what to say,
the pain of awkwardness can cut deep.
whether it&amp;rsquo;s sounding stupid (because we absolutely
all care about how we are perceived to others.
don&amp;rsquo;t act like you&amp;rsquo;re immune.)
or feeling like you just don&amp;rsquo;t get it,
awkwardness is practically always painful.
my parents asked me what i wanted for christmas this year,
and i genuinely had no idea what to ask for.</description></item><item><title>long weekends</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/long-weekends/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/long-weekends/</guid><description>remember long weekends as a kid?
those endless Saturdays..
but they somehow went by too fast.
or semester breaks in general. the glory
that came with not needing to wake up to
go to school.. but the sadness of not
being able to see your friends for some time.
when i take long weekends using vacation days
as a working adult, i evoke similar vibes from
those times. gotta go degen mode for sure on</description></item><item><title>ambience tracks and vgm</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/ambience-tracks-and-vgm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/ambience-tracks-and-vgm/</guid><description>something you may never have noticed
about youtube mixes like &amp;ldquo;relaxing cafe lofi&amp;rdquo;
or &amp;ldquo;animal crossing relaxing music&amp;rdquo;
is that half the time they come with
annoying fuckass crunchy rain ambience.
i think some channels can do it.
but definitely not all of them.
and it just sucks to see what would
otherwise be a great mix that accomplishes

too loud sound of &amp;ldquo;rain&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>staying up even later somehow</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/staying-up-even-later-somehow/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/staying-up-even-later-somehow/</guid><description>how are you with your sleep schedule?
if you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me,
completely goddamn terrible.
without fail i stay up later
and later playing video games or
scrolling social media or watching
youtube and stuff. generally unproductive
things. and then the times just goes.
on one hand, i feel guilty.
i should be going to bed so i can
be rested for the day tomorrow.
but on the other hand this time that i spend</description></item><item><title>merry christmas</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/merry-christmas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/merry-christmas/</guid><description>merry christmas!
today is the federal holiday of Christmas
in the United States of America.
we celebrate the birthday of Jesus Christ,
the Son of God (in the christian religion).
more broadly, we celebrate Santa Claus
and the spirit of gift-giving and togetherness.
it is a beautiful holiday that stands in the
calendar year as a testament to the optimism
of the human soul to persevere despite the odds.
christmas to me is cozy.</description></item></channel></rss>
