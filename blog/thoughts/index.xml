i, like many children, argue with my parents.
we have occasional conflicts in our ideas about life.
and i have come to understand that the context of their lives
are key to reaching an understanding of my own.
that is to say, sometimes they just get pissed at me

other times, i find genuine merit behind my parents' criticisms.</description></item><item><title>hot chocolate in the summer</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/hot-chocolate-in-the-summer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/hot-chocolate-in-the-summer/</guid><description>hot chocolate in the summer is underrated.
as someone whose favorite season is winter, which is, of course
the season of hot chocolate, i often find myself reaching for a mug
of hot cocoa, especially in the summertime (since winter seems so far away..)

but i&amp;rsquo;ve recently been trying out Ghirardelli premium to great satisfaction.</description></item><item><title>running it down mid</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/running-it-down-mid/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/running-it-down-mid/</guid><description>if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been in a situation where the goal is clear,
and you know with certainty what you must do to succeed,

but i&amp;rsquo;d like to say i actually like their music.
undoubtedly their most famous track is &amp;ldquo;Sail&amp;rdquo; which terrorized
the internet and memes for the better part of a year around 2011.
following their success with &amp;ldquo;Sail&amp;rdquo;, they received deals from Valve
to make music packs for some of their games, like CS:GO and Dota 2.

i think part of me romanticizes ramen noodles
because of their association with anime and japan.
ichiraku ramen from Naruto just made it look so delicious.

and you make your choice from there with toppings.
the soup bases are typically shio, shoyu, tonkotsu, and miso.</description></item><item><title>orchestra concerts</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/orchestra-concerts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/orchestra-concerts/</guid><description>you ever go to a symphony orchestra concert?
as a final fantasy fan, i&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to go
to a few &amp;ldquo;Distant Worlds&amp;rdquo; performances at the
Chicago Symphony Center on Michigan Avenue.
today, i went to see the FF7 Rebirth Symphony Orchestra
on their second date of their worldwide tour!
i had the pleasure of going with a couple of friends.

i&amp;rsquo;ve talked about talking to people before,
where my point was that we should be understanding that
the basis of many relationships can be around mundane things.
but when you and another person are both into a niche thing?
that&amp;rsquo;s when the magic happens, i think.
