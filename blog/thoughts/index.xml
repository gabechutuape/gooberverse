in the figurative sense of being an npc with reference to other people,
and literally being an npc in like a video game or a movie or something.
like in a scene where the main character overhears something important
while they&amp;rsquo;re at a bar because two dudes are having a conversation that&amp;rsquo;s
just a little too loud, i&amp;rsquo;m imagining those guys getting interviewing like it&amp;rsquo;s</description></item><item><title>being an npc</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/today/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/today/</guid><description>i was thinking today about what it&amp;rsquo;s like being an npc.

some of the greatest laughs i&amp;rsquo;ve ever had were from jokes i said while talking to myself.
i was talking to myself earlier today when i was driving home from a bakery.
the car in front of me was going amazingly slowly,
but we were at that vague distance from where i would left turn that it&amp;rsquo;s like,</description></item><item><title>sounds and being weird</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/sounds-and-being-weird/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/sounds-and-being-weird/</guid><description>anyone else listen to stuff that only they listen to, and none of your friends can relate?
there&amp;rsquo;s a few things i&amp;rsquo;ve found that basically only i know myself to listen to:
ambient sound videos (walking in tokyo, library study asmr, sounds of a mcdonald&amp;rsquo;s) animal crossing music for fun (i downloaded local versions to listen to on spotify) the same thing that isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a full song for an obscenely long time once when grinding uni work, i listened to Dark Fantasy by Kanye West but just the first part where they literally go &amp;ldquo;can we get much higher so high oh oh oh&amp;rdquo; for 30 minutes straight work/study jazz streams on youtube that kind of don&amp;rsquo;t even feel like real music my coworkers and i were going to lunch one day and i was the driver,</description></item><item><title>my coffee journey</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/my-coffee-journey/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/my-coffee-journey/</guid><description>last year in January, i decided that i needed an addiction.
a new one, not just the usual childish addictions like videogames and anime.
no, i needed an adult addiction that was so powerful that it carries with it
an air of haughtiness that blows away all who dare question its validity.
so i decided to get into coffee.
i decided to get into making pour-over coffee at home for a few reasons:</description></item><item><title>pictures and photography</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/pictures-and-photography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/pictures-and-photography/</guid><description>we all go on random youtube binges right?
the ones where it&amp;rsquo;s a topic that you&amp;rsquo;ve briefly touched in the past,
and you never got fully into but seemed interesting at the time.
one of those for me is professional photography.
as someone who has done a fairly minimal amount of research into the
more detailed parts of the workflow of it all,
f numbers, apertures, shooting speeds, lens sizes, digital and film,</description></item><item><title>talking to people</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/talking-to-people/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/talking-to-people/</guid><description>how do you feel about being at parties with strangers?
do you go into it thinking it&amp;rsquo;s an exciting chance to meet new people?
are you anxious about having to answer questions about who you are?
every time i&amp;rsquo;m put in that situation, i wonder why i tend more to anxiety
rather than curiosity.
was it easier that way at some point in time? &amp;hellip;easier for who?
it&amp;rsquo;s quite relatable, actually.</description></item><item><title>thinking and doing</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/thinking-and-doing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/thinking-and-doing/</guid><description>thinking and doing are two modes of operation that i consider when talking about work.
this is to say i choose not to apply it with something whimsical or less &amp;ldquo;important&amp;rdquo;,
like my attitude with cooking eggs, or how i decide what clothes to wear.
&amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo; is when you make a plan of action to do something.
i think about it most when doing work at my job,
because usually to do my job, i need to at least plan a little bit.</description></item></channel></rss>
