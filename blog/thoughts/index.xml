LOOK BACK is an animated film about two girls who aspire to be mangaka,
or manga artists. it is a movie adaptation of a one-shot from Tatsuki Fujimoto,
the creator of popular manga CHAINSAW MAN, starring Denji (the chainsaw man).
one-shots in manga are a mangaka&amp;rsquo;s way of creative expression
either between projects or without the restriction of ongoing ones.</description></item><item><title>waiting to be served at a restaurant</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/waiting-to-be-served-at-a-restaurant/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/waiting-to-be-served-at-a-restaurant/</guid><description>you ever had a long wait for your food at a sit-down?
depending on the time you go, it makes sense.
lunch rush, or at a breakfast place maybe brunch rush,
the workers are gonna be busy and you won&amp;rsquo;t get it out
in like, 10 minutes. but ideally before 25 minutes, right?
i developed a new pang of self-consciousness while waiting
for my server to come take my order at a restaurant today:</description></item><item><title>the CCP</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-ccp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-ccp/</guid><description>how do you feel about CCP?
and i ain&amp;rsquo;t talking about the Chinese Communist Party,
i&amp;rsquo;m talking about Chocolate Chip Pancakes.
chocolate chip pancakes. i somewhat got into chocolate chip pancakes after
watching The Good Doctor because of all the Dr. Han memes
that were on Twitter, the show in which the protagonist,
Dr. Shaun Murphy&amp;rsquo;s favorite food is chocolate chip pancakes.</description></item><item><title>legend of zelda wind waker</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/legend-of-zelda-wind-waker/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/legend-of-zelda-wind-waker/</guid><description>remember the Nintendo GameCube?
the GameCube was host to many legendary Nintendo titles,
like Super Smash Bros. Melee and Mario Kart Double Dash.
however, if you ask me what was a standout hit from that time,
i&amp;rsquo;ve gotta go with The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker.

this was me recently after i somehow avoided
the entirety of &amp;ldquo;brat summer&amp;rdquo;, featuring charli xcx&amp;rsquo;s
album &amp;ldquo;brat&amp;rdquo;, which debuted to the warm reception
of many twitter users and club-goers alike.
perhaps the most popular track, &amp;ldquo;360&amp;rdquo;, ended up
in my lap after i saw a isco elysium-style edit it
featuring the main character performing a 360 spinning back kick.
i&amp;rsquo;ve been spamming this song while playing space marine 2</description></item><item><title>old age</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/old-age/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/old-age/</guid><description>how old do you think is &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo;?
for humans, i feel like you aren&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo;
until you&amp;rsquo;re like, in your 50s. and even then,
i might only call someone in their 60s truly &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo;.
healthspan is a concept that Peter Attia talks about
in his book Outlive which he defines as
the range of age in which we are healthy enough
to live our life to the extent of our wishes.</description></item><item><title>live concert experience</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/live-concert-experience/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/live-concert-experience/</guid><description>have you ever been to a live concert show?
i went today to the Victoria Theater to see
&amp;ldquo;Mass of the Fermenting Dregs&amp;rdquo;,
an indie japanese rock band touring the states.
i was in a party of 3, the other two of which
are one friend who is obsessed with the band
and the other who just really likes going to live shows.
