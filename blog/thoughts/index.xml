pausing before you speak can really be
powerful beyond what you might think it accomplishes.
i mean, i&amp;rsquo;m 24. sure, it sounds kind of
ridiculous to be making this discovery at my age
as opposed to like, 12 years old. but i&amp;rsquo;d say
the best lessons are ones you learn for yourself.
nothing beats a primary source, after all.
so in listening to one of my new higher-ups,</description></item><item><title>political content consumption</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/political-content-consumption/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/political-content-consumption/</guid><description>do you have anything in your life
that you thought you would never get into
but one day, that all changed?
this most recent presidential election has me
more interested in consuming political content
to a degree far greater than ever before in my life.
that is also to say, i used to be of the mind
that political discussion would simply forever be
outside of my wheelhouse and that everyone having</description></item><item><title>complacency in performance</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/complacency-in-performance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/complacency-in-performance/</guid><description>if you learn how to do something,
have you ever noticed how it feels like
you get a little &amp;ldquo;worse&amp;rdquo; at it?
when you accomplish a hard thing and finally
reach your goal, if you want to do that same thing
again you end up not being able to meet that
expectation despite having provably done it before.
what happened? subconsciously, you got complacent.

the most in moments when it&amp;rsquo;s probably
inappropriate for you to be sleeping there.
like at work,
or during lecture,
or while you&amp;rsquo;re waiting for something,
and it can never be when you can just..
sleep a little.
maybe this is just a me thing.
it&amp;rsquo;s largely solved by just sleeping enough at night
and not doing things that are boring or uninteresting.</description></item><item><title>clearing the omega protocol</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/clearing-the-omega-protocol/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/clearing-the-omega-protocol/</guid><description>today, i cleared The Omega Protocol (Ultimate) in FFXIV.
my TOP clear screenshot, 11-21-24. if you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with why that achievement matters,
allow me to explain.
FFXIV Ultimates are a type of raid taken on by 8 players.
they are denoted as &amp;ldquo;Ultimate&amp;rdquo; as opposed to &amp;ldquo;Savage&amp;rdquo;,
which is a different tier of raid difficulty, or &amp;ldquo;Extreme&amp;rdquo;,
which is another different tier of difficulty.</description></item><item><title>crab legs as food</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/crab-legs-as-food/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/crab-legs-as-food/</guid><description>my thing with crab legs as food is that
it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work to pry open.
when i was a kid, with my soft baby hands,
i wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to open crab legs and so i never
grew and interest in eating crabs even though
they&amp;rsquo;re a classic filipino food, the seafarers that they are.
as an adult now, i realize that inanimate crab shells
pose basically no threat to me and i can crack them open</description></item><item><title>coping vs acknowledging</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/coping-vs-acknowledging/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/coping-vs-acknowledging/</guid><description>are you the kind of person who likes
to rip the bandaid off when it comes to
the bad news? or do you cope a little bit?
coping is a mechanism where you act like
things are better than they are because
to acknowledge that they aren&amp;rsquo;t would do
greater mental damage to you than you can
sustain at that given moment.
usually, when you cope, the longer you&amp;rsquo;ve
been coping, the worse it is when you rip</description></item></channel></rss>
