they&amp;rsquo;re like &amp;ldquo;oh it&amp;rsquo;s fine you don&amp;rsquo;t need to get me anything!&amp;quot;
and then when you proceed to listen to them and get them nothing,
they&amp;rsquo;re upset by it?
you can probably think of at least one time this has happened
and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty annoying. i mean, there&amp;rsquo;s something to be said about
that line that they gave being a social cue that, yes, they would be</description></item><item><title>ignoring someone</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/ignoring-someone/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/ignoring-someone/</guid><description>is it an adult thing to do
to ignore someone you&amp;rsquo;re in proximity with
rather than working your problems out together?
i&amp;rsquo;m all for a healthy amount of distancing,
but i think outright ignoring someone is childish. confront each other
with intention and purpose and not just for the sake
of getting it over with,
but do it for fucks' sake if you&amp;rsquo;re going to do it.
we&amp;rsquo;re too old to be doing shit like</description></item><item><title>sleep apnea</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/sleep-apnea/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/sleep-apnea/</guid><description>my sleep apnea has been acting up recently.
i attribute this to the weight i&amp;rsquo;ve gained over the winter.
it&amp;rsquo;s quite annoying, and i didn&amp;rsquo;t realize how much of it was
simply due to having more mass around your neck, so to speak.
i think sleep apnea mostly affects overweight people
rather than people who have something fucked up about their airway.
i mean i&amp;rsquo;m sure not everyone with sleep apnea is overweight,</description></item><item><title>nothing changes if nothing changes</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/nothing-changes-if-nothing-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/nothing-changes-if-nothing-changes/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve been getting a bunch of ads for the company burga,
which manufactures phone cases with artistic designs and collaborations.
one of them recently features some.. famous french dude?
who has some sticky-note style handwritten quotes
as the &amp;ldquo;art&amp;rdquo; for the phone case.
one of the handwritten quotes is &amp;ldquo;nothing changes if nothing changes&amp;rdquo;,
which is something i&amp;rsquo;ve always known but never put into words like that.
i was aware that the cost of a new life is your current life.</description></item><item><title>bitingly cold</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/bitingly-cold/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/bitingly-cold/</guid><description>one time when i was in high school,
i described the air as &amp;ldquo;sharp&amp;rdquo;.
it was a description of how it felt to breathe extremely cold air
into your nose with the massive temperature difference and speed
of inhalation almost making it feel like a cut inside your nose.
i like the weirdly precise descriptors we have for temperature
like that. the air was sharp, it&amp;rsquo;s bitingly cold, it&amp;rsquo;s hot as balls.</description></item><item><title>couchsurfing</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/couchsurfing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/couchsurfing/</guid><description>i think the reason it&amp;rsquo;s called couchsurfing is because
you&amp;rsquo;re going from place to place, i.e., different couches,
and crashing on them in sequence day to day.
i believe that going to different couches is what makes it
specifically count as couchsurfing.
however, for the purposes of my life experience having never done that,
i count the periods of time where i sleep on my couch instead of my bed</description></item><item><title>not every month has the same amount of days</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/not-every-month-has-the-same-amount-of-days/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/not-every-month-has-the-same-amount-of-days/</guid><description>something that i consider a personal failing is that
i can&amp;rsquo;t remember what months have 30 days, and which ones
have 31 days. (nevermind february and when it has 28 or 29 days).
which is to say, i never bothered memorizing this information.
it was never critical to learn. whether or not i knew which months
were longer never helped me in a profound way.
so it makes sense i didn&amp;rsquo;t learn it.</description></item></channel></rss>
