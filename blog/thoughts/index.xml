do you go into it thinking it&amp;rsquo;s an exciting chance to meet new people?
are you anxious about having to answer questions about who you are?
every time i&amp;rsquo;m put in that situation, i wonder why i tend more to anxiety
rather than curiosity.
was it easier that way at some point in time? &amp;hellip;easier for who?
it&amp;rsquo;s quite relatable, actually.</description></item><item><title>talking to people</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/today/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/today/</guid><description>how do you feel about being at parties with strangers?

this is to say i choose not to apply it with something whimsical or less &amp;ldquo;important&amp;rdquo;,
like my attitude with cooking eggs, or how i decide what clothes to wear.
&amp;ldquo;thinking&amp;rdquo; is when you make a plan of action to do something.
i think about it most when doing work at my job,
because usually to do my job, i need to at least plan a little bit.</description></item></channel></rss>
