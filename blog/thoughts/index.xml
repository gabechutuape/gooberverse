i don&amp;rsquo;t mean breathing. i mean something that requires active
consciousness and participation that you can&amp;rsquo;t do without trying.
something like writing a manuscript, or reading a book,
or doing something outside, or even doing work.
today, i spent 10 hours playing deadlock.
625 minutes is just over 10 hours. so.</description></item><item><title>what to do if the day sucks</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-to-do-if-the-day-sucks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-to-do-if-the-day-sucks/</guid><description>you ever go to work and just have an absolute poopoo day?
i&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how i self-medicate shit days.
usually it&amp;rsquo;s just indulgence in some form..
like ordering takeout or gaming or sleeping..
work today was kind of a bummer so i went to my local
boba place to get a mocha milk tea to get the vibes going again.
but it got me thinking,
should i just simply feel bad when it&amp;rsquo;s a bad day</description></item><item><title>in-game names</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/in-game-names/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/in-game-names/</guid><description>if you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with igns, or in-game names,
they&amp;rsquo;re a way to call someone in a game. their username.
or their character name. or their display name.
my first username that i can remember was Project_Star,
back on a korean mmo that i forget the name of (not MapleStory).
i used a lot of different names like Project_Silver, Project_WAR,
and in the present day, ProjectG (for gabe).
in-game names are fun because they&amp;rsquo;re what people choose most of the time</description></item><item><title>what about culver's?</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-about-culvers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-about-culvers/</guid><description>you wanna go to culver&amp;rsquo;s?
Culver&amp;rsquo;s is a midwestern classic.
it features their signature &amp;ldquo;butterburgers&amp;rdquo;,
which are burgers with their buns buttered,
as well as cheese curds on the side.
if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough for you, they also make
pretty good desserts in the realm of milkshakes and concrete mixers.
there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of decadent options available.
for a while, i had a slight apprehension to culver&amp;rsquo;s,
since it&amp;rsquo;s so greasy and whatnot.</description></item><item><title>car air fresheners</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/car-air-fresheners/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/car-air-fresheners/</guid><description>do you have an air freshener in your car?
some people like the trees. &amp;ldquo;Black Ice&amp;rdquo;, apparently,
is the scent of choice. supposed to be like new car smell.
new car smell is apparently due to leather outgassing,
by the way. all the plastics and adhesives inside the car
expand from heat and release a &amp;ldquo;smell&amp;rdquo;. which some people like!
i kinda liked new car smell, but i wasn&amp;rsquo;t the biggest fan.</description></item><item><title>taking out the trash</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/taking-out-the-trash/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/taking-out-the-trash/</guid><description>is today trash day for you?
in our neighborhood, trash day is monday.
so, taking out the trash gets added to my sunday list of chores.
it&amp;rsquo;s not a particularly long list, usually just laundry and trash.
for a long time taking out the trash was not habitual,
and i would often forget to do it on sundays.
when i was on campus, this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really matter, since
the trash just goes to the bin behind the apartment.</description></item><item><title>changing seasons</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/changing-seasons/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/changing-seasons/</guid><description>when September rolls around is when i start thinking that seasons are changing.
persona 3 has a great track called changing of the seasons that i think of this time of year (although in-game, this track doesn&amp;rsquo;t play around September.)
my 2nd favorite season is probably fall, next to winter. the red and orange colored leaves are just amazing to look at. makes you feel young when you drive underneath trees like that.</description></item></channel></rss>
