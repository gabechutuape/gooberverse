just how many lies you tell yourself.
stuff like assumptions about way things work,
ways you think people interpret what you do,
ways you think things should go, and ways
you do the things you do.
one i&amp;rsquo;m recently trying to tackle is my perception
of the difficulty of &amp;ldquo;doing&amp;rdquo; things.
people say stuff like, going to the gym is &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo;.
but what if it weren&amp;rsquo;t hard?</description></item><item><title>my current favorite hoodie</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/my-current-favorite-hoodie/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/my-current-favorite-hoodie/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;m a big hoodie enjoyer.
i have a huge collection in my closet,
and it is my preferred top layer.
the usual issues i have with finding &amp;ldquo;good hoodies&amp;rdquo;
are that they need to meet certain criteria, namely:
a boxy silhouette (my chest is wide) slightly cropped, but not too cropped (my torso is short) arms that are nice and baggy but NOT too long (something that has a cuff that sits halfway on your hand is super ideal for the cozy vibe) a nice, structured hood that is big enough for my big ass head a heavy enough weight to conquer any morning when i feel like absolute garbage about the way i look a big enough kangaroo pouch/pockets to rest my hands in comfortably for a while, i was rocking Abercrombie&amp;rsquo;s relaxed popover hoodies.</description></item><item><title>fruitmaxxing</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/fruitmaxxing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/fruitmaxxing/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve been on a fruit kick lately.
apples, bananas, even some pears.
throw a few oranges in there too.
this stuff is honestly the shit.
sugar, carbs, fiber, all in a nice
little package that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel
like absolute dogshit for your body
to be consuming? sign me up.
i&amp;rsquo;m not sure when i fell off the
fruit bandwagon, but boy was i
an idiot for letting that happen.
it&amp;rsquo;s literally as the saying goes.</description></item><item><title>the doomed nature of napping</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-doomed-nature-of-napping/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-doomed-nature-of-napping/</guid><description>isn&amp;rsquo;t it a fucked thing,
to bear the consequences of a nap
so far after the initial mistake?
let&amp;rsquo;s lay down some ground facts here.
the initial mistake is definitely reaching a point
where you feel a nap is necessary. this could be
staying up too late, or eating too much food.
usually something excessive in some form has occurred
to feel as though you should humor a nap.
but here&amp;rsquo;s the thing:</description></item><item><title>the shifting oubliettes</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-shifting-oubliettes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-shifting-oubliettes/</guid><description>what the hell is an oubliette?
and why are they shifting?
an oubliette, or at least, the top image result when you search &amp;ldquo;oubliette&amp;rdquo; on google. turns out an oubliette is French word for a specific kind of dungeon, or cellar.
oubliettes, specifically, only have one entrance and exit: a hatch in the ceiling.
sounds terrifying, frankly.
i bring up the &amp;ldquo;shifting oubliettes&amp;rdquo; in reference to the FFXIV treasure dungeons:</description></item><item><title>chesters hot fries</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/chesters-hot-fries/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/chesters-hot-fries/</guid><description>have you ever had a bag of chester&amp;rsquo;s hot fries?
they&amp;rsquo;re one of my favorite snacks of all time.
the legendary bag design of chester&amp;rsquo;s hot fries. chester&amp;rsquo;s hot fries, distinct from the Cheetos line of products
from Frito-Lay, are a bag that was once priced at $2 only for
a 6 oz bag of chips shaped like fries, with a saltiness, crunch</description></item><item><title>thoughts of the new year</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/thoughts-of-the-new-year/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/thoughts-of-the-new-year/</guid><description>what do you think about when you think of the new year?
my mind goes to the winter season in animal crossing games.
animal crossing is, as you know, one of my favorites. christmas, of course, is represented by the complete darkness of the living room
save for the beacon of light that is the christmas tree
left on overnight to keep the magic of the holiday alive.</description></item></channel></rss>
