nights by frank ocean? a legendary beatswitch.
what triggered this thought? i was listening to
the dandadan opening, which features
an almost ethereal beatswitch every other 1/4th of the song.
another famous beatswitch was Logic&amp;rsquo;s Under Pressure,
where he switches perspectives from his hustling self
to the perspective of a little sister writing a plea for help
to their brother, and a father wishing to reconnect with his son.</description></item><item><title>calm before the storm</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/calm-before-the-storm/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/calm-before-the-storm/</guid><description>the &amp;ldquo;calm before the storm&amp;rdquo; describes
the uneasy lull in pacing before a decisive moment occurs.
present in almost anything involving action,
the calm before the storm is a terrifying thing.
i deal with nerves in tense situations a lot.
and the calm before the storm is a thing that,
at first glance, you might think is a fine respite
preceding the storm which must occur. but you almost
grow to associate them with one another; that the storm</description></item><item><title>chewing the fat</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/chewing-the-fat/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/chewing-the-fat/</guid><description>have you ever heard of the term &amp;ldquo;chewing the fat&amp;rdquo;?
apparently it means to gossip or make small talk
or otherwise have informal conversation with someone.
my assumption was that chewing the fat would mean like,
we&amp;rsquo;re ironing out the kinks or something? or we&amp;rsquo;re going
through the shittiest, swampiest part of the thing we&amp;rsquo;re doing?
but no, it actually means having small talk. and surprisingly
the origin, on Wikipedia, is contentious: nobody actually knows</description></item><item><title>balloon and other dinky songs</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/balloon-and-other-dinky-songs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/balloon-and-other-dinky-songs/</guid><description>balloon by tyler the creator from his new album,
&amp;ldquo;chromakopia&amp;rdquo; is definitely a dinky song.
dinky songs are ones that sound like they&amp;rsquo;re being played
with tiny instruments or by dudes in goofy looking costumes.
they can generally be applied for comedic and diminutive effect.
a famous dinky song is that one dinky ass song from kirby.
i like to use dinky songs to calm myself down in tense situations,</description></item><item><title>are some days just bad days</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/are-some-days-just-bad-days/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/are-some-days-just-bad-days/</guid><description>if you&amp;rsquo;re a human like me,
you&amp;rsquo;ve definitely had bad days before.
but when &amp;ldquo;bad days&amp;rdquo; strike on days when you
need to perform to a certain level that is expected,
what can you do to mitigate the effects of the curse?
i like to just pretend it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist,
but the thing with superstitions is that they pervade
the conscious realm and kinda seep around in the
beneath-layer of your mind&amp;hellip; its imperceptibility</description></item><item><title>the joe rogan experience</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-joe-rogan-experience/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-joe-rogan-experience/</guid><description>truth be told, i&amp;rsquo;ve never really
exercised my political muscles at all.
i think for a large percentage of young people,
it&amp;rsquo;s easier to just kind of not think about
this type of stuff when people are always like
&amp;ldquo;server rules are no politics.&amp;rdquo;
but if you go looking in the right places,
you find the discussion channels for it,
and that&amp;rsquo;s where the real grimy shit happens.
like the joe rogan experience!</description></item><item><title>chewing gum enjoyers</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/chewing-gum-enjoyers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/chewing-gum-enjoyers/</guid><description>when&amp;rsquo;s the last time you chewed gum?
back in high school and under days,
chewing gum was the absolute item to have.
you could trade it for anything.
either that, or you would take a piece out
and then the person next to you would be like
&amp;ldquo;hey man, could i have one? :^)&amp;rdquo; and then
it&amp;rsquo;s like, well, i&amp;rsquo;m gaining social credit
by giving you this piece of gum but also</description></item></channel></rss>
