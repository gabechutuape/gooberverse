skywalk near o&amp;rsquo;hare terminal 1 arrivals. shot with Fujifilm X-T50. are you the kind of person who spins the block via recirculation road
or do you just get parking and eat the $2-$5 cost of using it
for less than an hour and then leaving?

i would recommend getting a burger from Au Cheval.
they&amp;rsquo;re a michelin-star restaurant that serves
specifically diner fare, but make it gourmet.
they&amp;rsquo;re best known for their burgers which feature
a sunny-side up egg, as well as their garlic aioli.
i took a neat picture of a spotlight at our table
that had a glass of water and some cutlery.
i forgot to take a picture of the actual burger.</description></item><item><title>broccoli cheddar soup</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/broccoli-cheddar-soup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/broccoli-cheddar-soup/</guid><description>broccoli cheddar soup is a beautiful thing.
the melted, slightly salty flavor from the cheese,
the scent of broccoli wafting into your nose,
and the ear-to-ear warmth that a spoonful gives.
i recently rediscovered broccoli cheddar soup
at my local Potbelly sandwich shop on lunch break.
the first time i had broccoli cheddar was
my freshman year of college, six years ago.
i&amp;rsquo;ve never gone out of my way to purchase it,</description></item><item><title>coasting through the week</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/coasting-through-the-week/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/coasting-through-the-week/</guid><description>you ever phone it in for the day at work?
sometimes for me, that turns into an entire week.
the progress isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly.. critical.. so i never feel
particularly awful about not doing much when those times strike.
but it definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel great to just kinda do nothing
so i end up doing the bare minimum of everything to get credit
and then skating past it into the next week, hoping things will be different then.</description></item><item><title>political identity</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/political-identity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/political-identity/</guid><description>political identity is a complicated thing for me.
for a while, it was a scary thing to have a label and put labels on things like
&amp;ldquo;how should the world be?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;how is the world now?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;what is my government doing?&amp;quot;
and understanding that taking a stance means you can&amp;rsquo;t have the benefits of all slices of the pie.

my first razer mouse was a razer naga hex, which was very useful when i was playing Dota 2 as it was made to accommodate the 6 slot inventory of potential active items in the game. after that, i had a deathadder elite original, but gave it up because i wanted more side buttons. the shape was something i would never forget, however.</description></item><item><title>are you who you are without your surroundings?</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/are-you-who-you-are-without-your-surroundings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/are-you-who-you-are-without-your-surroundings/</guid><description>i sometimes think about how we can tell who we are.
in the sense of, what things are there and how do i know i am myself,
and not somebody else who is taking someone else&amp;rsquo;s place in my body?
if you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell, imposter syndrome runs pretty deep around here.
