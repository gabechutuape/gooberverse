there is a lot of elitism.
people get in days, weeks-long dickmeasuring contests
over who cleared when, which strat is better,
who&amp;rsquo;s better at DPS, who&amp;rsquo;s better at healing,
who&amp;rsquo;s a braindead idiot moron who can&amp;rsquo;t do mechanics,
who&amp;rsquo;s a genius prodigy who is infallible in all parties.
it&amp;rsquo;s tiresome. a fucking chore. disgusting, honestly.
and it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting microcosm of reality.
in the world of online screens, anonymity is king.</description></item><item><title>retracing your steps</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/retracing-your-steps/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/retracing-your-steps/</guid><description>i assume since you&amp;rsquo;re a human reading this,
you&amp;rsquo;re not immune to the nostalgia bug.
what do i mean by the nostalgia bug?
i mean the warm, fuzzy feeling you get from
retracing your childhood or reconnecting
with something that you used to love.
recently, i&amp;rsquo;ve been rewatching Skermz (a DBD streamer)&amp;rsquo;s
twitch vods to fill time while i queue for FFXIV ultimates,
and i feel happy again. it reminds me of the days i spent</description></item><item><title>cookies n cream</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/cookies-n-cream/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/cookies-n-cream/</guid><description>what are your favorite ice cream flavors?
one that&amp;rsquo;s a surprising goat for me,
but maybe not for others, is cookies n cream.
like an oreo type vibe? those are great.
i&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of pistachio, mocha/coffee flavors,
cookies n cream. those are probably my top 3.
the reason why cookies n cream is surprising for me
is because as a kid, i thought it was kind of bland.</description></item><item><title>listening to kpop</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/listening-to-kpop/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/listening-to-kpop/</guid><description>are you a fan of kpop at all?
as an asian person, i felt an obligation
culturally to learn about the phenomenon
of kpop. after all, if i was into it, i would
probably be cool. and being cool is a great
primary motivator for someone like me.
i got into it at first with recommendations
from a friend to try &amp;ldquo;Stray Kids&amp;rdquo;. well,
actually now that i think about it, &amp;ldquo;Stray Kids&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>town outing</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/town-outing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/town-outing/</guid><description>do you live near an urban area
that has cool stuff for you to do
but is a decent drive away?
i&amp;rsquo;m 40-ish minutes out from Chicago,
which is a pretty big hub for basically
anything you could think of in terms of
entertainment or food or what have you.
in my case, sometimes i go with my friends
to restaurants to sample higher-end cuisine
than the stuff we can find in the suburbs</description></item><item><title>surprisingly</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/surprisingly/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/surprisingly/</guid><description>doesn&amp;rsquo;t it just suck when your
preconceived notion of things is
challenged by new facts brought to your attention?
i thought KSI was a reprehensible dude,
and i still kind of think he is spiritually.
but part of that judgment being cast was
the quality of his song &amp;ldquo;Thick of It&amp;rdquo;.
what&amp;rsquo;s changed? i heard his older song,
&amp;ldquo;Lose&amp;rdquo; with him and Lil Wayne, and it&amp;rsquo;s actually
pretty good. so now i gotta give him credit.</description></item><item><title>good hoodies</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/good-hoodies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/good-hoodies/</guid><description>do you wear hoodies? or are they
too schlubby/casual for you?
i&amp;rsquo;m a big hoodie enjoyer. i love my hoodies.
i have a hell of a collection. a shitload of them,
a lot of which i don&amp;rsquo;t even wear regularly.
but if there&amp;rsquo;s something i&amp;rsquo;m surely addicted to,
it&amp;rsquo;s buying hoodies that i think i&amp;rsquo;m gonna wear.
i recently picked up two Akimbo Club hoodies,
a pullover and a full-zip, and an Hours Collection</description></item></channel></rss>
