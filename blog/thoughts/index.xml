in the sense of, what things are there and how do i know i am myself,
and not somebody else who is taking someone else&amp;rsquo;s place in my body?
if you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell, imposter syndrome runs pretty deep around here.
but i hear that using your external surroundings is a good way
to reinforce who you are and what you do, at least in terms of</description></item><item><title>the idea of the two-day weekend</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-idea-of-the-two-day-weekend/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-idea-of-the-two-day-weekend/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about two-day weekends.
right now in society in america,
we abide by the two-day weekend.
you get saturday and sunday off work,
then you work monday through friday.
but the only real two-day weekend in my opinion
could possibly be if you had friday and monday off as well.
you see, in its current state,
saturday is spent recovering from friday
having been a workday already.
and sunday is spent worrying about</description></item><item><title>genuine dedication or utter foolishness?</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/genuine-dedication-or-utter-foolishness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/genuine-dedication-or-utter-foolishness/</guid><description>how long have you ever spent doing a single thing?
i don&amp;rsquo;t mean breathing. i mean something that requires active
consciousness and participation that you can&amp;rsquo;t do without trying.
something like writing a manuscript, or reading a book,
or doing something outside, or even doing work.
today, i spent 10 hours playing deadlock.
625 minutes is just over 10 hours. so.</description></item><item><title>what to do if the day sucks</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-to-do-if-the-day-sucks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-to-do-if-the-day-sucks/</guid><description>you ever go to work and just have an absolute poopoo day?
i&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how i self-medicate shit days.
usually it&amp;rsquo;s just indulgence in some form..
like ordering takeout or gaming or sleeping..
work today was kind of a bummer so i went to my local
boba place to get a mocha milk tea to get the vibes going again.
but it got me thinking,
should i just simply feel bad when it&amp;rsquo;s a bad day</description></item><item><title>in-game names</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/in-game-names/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/in-game-names/</guid><description>if you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with igns, or in-game names,
they&amp;rsquo;re a way to call someone in a game. their username.
or their character name. or their display name.
my first username that i can remember was Project_Star,
back on a korean mmo that i forget the name of (not MapleStory).
i used a lot of different names like Project_Silver, Project_WAR,
and in the present day, ProjectG (for gabe).
in-game names are fun because they&amp;rsquo;re what people choose most of the time</description></item><item><title>what about culver's?</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-about-culvers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-about-culvers/</guid><description>you wanna go to culver&amp;rsquo;s?
Culver&amp;rsquo;s is a midwestern classic.
it features their signature &amp;ldquo;butterburgers&amp;rdquo;,
which are burgers with their buns buttered,
as well as cheese curds on the side.
if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough for you, they also make
pretty good desserts in the realm of milkshakes and concrete mixers.
there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of decadent options available.
for a while, i had a slight apprehension to culver&amp;rsquo;s,
since it&amp;rsquo;s so greasy and whatnot.</description></item><item><title>car air fresheners</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/car-air-fresheners/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/car-air-fresheners/</guid><description>do you have an air freshener in your car?
some people like the trees. &amp;ldquo;Black Ice&amp;rdquo;, apparently,
is the scent of choice. supposed to be like new car smell.
new car smell is apparently due to leather outgassing,
by the way. all the plastics and adhesives inside the car
expand from heat and release a &amp;ldquo;smell&amp;rdquo;. which some people like!
i kinda liked new car smell, but i wasn&amp;rsquo;t the biggest fan.</description></item></channel></rss>
