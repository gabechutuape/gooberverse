i am back to using the qk65 v2 from qwertykeys.
i built this keyboard out using Sunny Side Up linear switches from CannonKeys.
these switches were chosen because i thought they were a
rather neat looking gag of a switch design; i was pleasantly surprised
at how nice they sound after lubing and filming.
honestly, probably my favorite linear of all time</description></item><item><title>internet issues</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/internet-issues/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/internet-issues/</guid><description>ask any person who spends time on their computer:
the worst thing ever is internet issues.
people don&amp;rsquo;t like feeling like they&amp;rsquo;re
not in control, unsurprisingly, and so
when it comes to catastrophic problems
that are basically strictly out of your
hands, internet problems take the cake.
restart the router? are there a shitload of people
using the wifi at your house? are you gonna have to
talk to a support line to get this shit fixed?</description></item><item><title>hyperfocus</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/hyperfocus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/hyperfocus/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;hyperfocus&amp;rdquo; is usually synonymous with the
zone state of mind that one attains when perfect
conditions are met for single-minded concentration
on a task, with efficacy towards its completion.
when i think about the word, i think about
the perk from Dead by Daylight, from Rebecca Chambers.
it makes it so that when you pass great skill checks,
you get a bonus speed up to your generator repair rate.
have i recently hyperfocused on anything?</description></item><item><title>bloodshot eyes</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/bloodshot-eyes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/bloodshot-eyes/</guid><description>i heard from one of my older coworkers that
eventually, as you age, you require less sleep.
makes sense, metabolic function and all decreases
as you grow up since you&amp;rsquo;re not.. growing anymore.
i just never put two and two together that the
aches and pains that seem to persist because your
body isn&amp;rsquo;t recycling itself as quickly as it used to
was equivalent or in tandem with not getting more sleep.</description></item><item><title>ksi's thick of it</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/ksis-thick-of-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/ksis-thick-of-it/</guid><description>have you heard ksi&amp;rsquo;s new song?
people are clowning on it on the internet daily.
feedback like, &amp;ldquo;it sounds corny&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;KSI sucks&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;the song is trash&amp;rdquo;, etc etc.
well let me be the first to tell you:
it&amp;rsquo;s true. the song is corny. it sounds like
it came out in 2018 for the summer season.
which is not to say it sounds literally terrible
it just.. sounds quite generic. and also</description></item><item><title>nerfs vs buffs in game design</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/nerfs-vs-buffs-in-game-design/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/nerfs-vs-buffs-in-game-design/</guid><description>it&amp;rsquo;s a fact:
gamers hate nerfs.
they love buffs.
..now there&amp;rsquo;s clearly more nuance to that
than just those two statements, but for the
most part, especially in PvE games, people
far more enjoy buffs than nerfs from gamedevs.
so why do developers nerf stats?
i have no idea. if i knew the answer to that,
do you think i would be writing a post like this?\
it blows. maybe they hate the way the meta</description></item><item><title>putting it on something</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/putting-it-on-something/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/putting-it-on-something/</guid><description>you ever heard of putting it on something?
like when someone says &amp;ldquo;on my mama&amp;rdquo;,
or &amp;ldquo;on the dead homies&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;on god&amp;rdquo;,
you ever wonder what they mean?
to &amp;ldquo;put it on something&amp;rdquo; means to lay claim
that what you&amp;rsquo;re saying is true, and if
you&amp;rsquo;re lying, then curse the reputation of
whoever is incited in the phrase.
the person who is incited implies the degree
of severity to which someone attests that</description></item></channel></rss>
