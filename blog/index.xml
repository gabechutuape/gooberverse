too schlubby/casual for you?
i&amp;rsquo;m a big hoodie enjoyer. i love my hoodies.
i have a hell of a collection. a shitload of them,
a lot of which i don&amp;rsquo;t even wear regularly.
but if there&amp;rsquo;s something i&amp;rsquo;m surely addicted to,
it&amp;rsquo;s buying hoodies that i think i&amp;rsquo;m gonna wear.
i recently picked up two Akimbo Club hoodies,
a pullover and a full-zip, and an Hours Collection</description></item><item><title>sugar rush</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/sugar-rush/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/sugar-rush/</guid><description>are you a candy enjoyer? or, more generally,
how are you with partaking of sweets?
i&amp;rsquo;m a guy who enjoys candy. you can ask some
of my friends, i&amp;rsquo;ve dropped a line in the past
that went something like, &amp;ldquo;dude, for literally like $3.99,
you can literally purchase around 30-60 minutes of happiness.&amp;quot;
in reference to the idea of purchasing a bag of skittles.
skittles rule. fruit flavored candies are good.</description></item><item><title>dry skin in the winter</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/dry-skin-in-the-winter/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/dry-skin-in-the-winter/</guid><description>how is the quality of your skin
during the wintertime?
i need a very particularly plentiful amount
of lotion pretty much everywhere to maintain
the healthiness of my skin when it gets cold
and dry outside. especially my hands.
whenever the dryness of my hands gets to me,
i lament the natural flow of things that are
beneficial to you to only feel necessary when
you have fallen victim to a trap already.</description></item><item><title>interjecting and riffing</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/interjecting-and-riffing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/interjecting-and-riffing/</guid><description>you ever try and talk to people
that you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with?
fucking sucks, man.
i think i&amp;rsquo;ve written about this before.
but i&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to type more in the
North American Ultimate Raiding discord server
among the great regulars of that discord.
let&amp;rsquo;s get this out of the way:
establishing a presence in a public discord
is about as spiritually useful as microwaving dogshit
and having it for breakfast.</description></item><item><title>taming the beast</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/taming-the-beast/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/taming-the-beast/</guid><description>anyone have any good answers for
how to reconcile the beastly nature
of mankind versus the altruistic sense
that we&amp;rsquo;ve developed as humans?
i&amp;rsquo;m talking about the stuff where it feels
like the right thing to do is the exact
opposite of the thing that feels good to do.
what&amp;rsquo;s up with that. why can&amp;rsquo;t they be the same.
it&amp;rsquo;s fucked up that it&amp;rsquo;s not that way.
whoever designed it should have not made it that way.</description></item><item><title>tranquility in a safe space</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/tranquility-in-a-safe-space/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/tranquility-in-a-safe-space/</guid><description>never underestimate the calming feeling
brought about by being in a safe space.
safe spaces can be anything from being
with people you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with to
being by yourself in a place you know you
won&amp;rsquo;t be bothered by anybody.
(if you aren&amp;rsquo;t comfortable by yourself,
you got bigger problems to deal with than
interpreting the meaning of this blogpost.)

touhou is a japanese bullet hell video game series
with a shitload of lore (?) and a bunch of characters.
it apparently also has jazz and bossa nova music.
if i could describe touhou in one word, it would be &amp;ldquo;eternal&amp;rdquo;.
touhou has felt like it&amp;rsquo;s had its own corner of the internet
since i remember logging on to 4chan the first time in 2010.</description></item></channel></rss>
