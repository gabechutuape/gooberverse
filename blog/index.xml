do you go into it thinking it&amp;rsquo;s an exciting chance to meet new people?
are you anxious about having to answer questions about who you are?
every time i&amp;rsquo;m put in that situation, i wonder why i tend more to anxiety

it&amp;rsquo;s quite relatable, actually.</description></item><item><title>thinking and doing</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/thinking-and-doing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/thinking-and-doing/</guid><description>thinking and doing are two modes of operation that i consider when talking about work.
this is to say i choose not to apply it with something whimsical or less &amp;ldquo;important&amp;rdquo;,
like my attitude with cooking eggs, or how i decide what clothes to wear.

&amp;ldquo;mashing&amp;rdquo; is when there is a logical way to reach a solution,
but instead of going on that path,
you guess a solution until you either give up or it miraculously works.
