in the game, you play as a detective who is guided by his internal aspects,
like &amp;ldquo;pain threshold&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;reaction speed&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;visual calculus&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;inland empire&amp;rdquo;,
on your journey to solve the case of a hanged man and your retrograde amnesia.
it&amp;rsquo;s having me think a lot about how my self-talk works.
&amp;ldquo;volition&amp;rdquo; in this game is your ability to resist temptation,</description></item><item><title>sunscreen application</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/sunscreen-application/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/sunscreen-application/</guid><description>they say a lot of stuff about putting on sunscreen.
like how you should put on sunscreen basically every day,
or how you should put sunscreen on even if there are clouds,
and how the &amp;ldquo;repercussions are sooo terrible!!&amp;rdquo;
this is one of those things where i accept it
as a fact of life that i&amp;rsquo;m not in the stage where
i&amp;rsquo;m willing to accept that shit as an active</description></item><item><title>restaurant appetizers</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/restaurant-appetizers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/restaurant-appetizers/</guid><description>what kind of appetizers do you get?
i really like places that just have a thing
that is the appetizer without paying for it.
i&amp;rsquo;m talking olive garden bread and cheese,
or mexican places with chips and salsa.
but when i do have to pay money, if i&amp;rsquo;m with
a bunch of boys i do like getting some wings.
if i&amp;rsquo;m at a ramen place i&amp;rsquo;ll usually get
some takoyaki, or if i&amp;rsquo;m at a sushi or</description></item><item><title>getting tilted</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/getting-tilted/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/getting-tilted/</guid><description>getting tilted sucks.
tilted is a term that describes when you&amp;rsquo;re doing something
but you&amp;rsquo;re doing it while annoyed or frustrated
so you start doing worse
and then you wonder why you&amp;rsquo;re doing worse
so you try harder to do better
which usually is the opposite of what you should be doing
and then you do even more worse, which makes you more
frustrated, etc.
getting tilted usually only happens in</description></item><item><title>songs of the night, vol. 1</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/songs-of-the-night-vol.-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/songs-of-the-night-vol.-1/</guid><description>today i&amp;rsquo;m starting a series on the gooberverse
featuring songs that i think fit well in a night-time setting.
when i say night-time setting, i envision the glow of an LED monitor
on tired eyes, illuminating an otherwise wholly enveloped dark room,
the owner of such eyes acknowledging that while everyone sleeps, he alone is awake. or perhaps the constant frequency of overhead freeway lights
washing over a sedan as it makes its hour-long journey home at 11:58PM,</description></item><item><title>never trust your thoughts after 11pm</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/never-trust-your-thoughts-after-11pm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/never-trust-your-thoughts-after-11pm/</guid><description>i heard something a long time ago.
something like an internet adage, or maybe from a TV show.
i&amp;rsquo;m not sure of the origin anymore, but it stuck around.
in forms different than it originally appeared.
&amp;ldquo;never trust your thoughts after 11pm.&amp;rdquo;
thoughts about.. what?
about yourself, or about your job,
or about people, or about things in general, i think.
it isn&amp;rsquo;t always 11pm either. it could be after midnight.</description></item><item><title>web gaming</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/web-gaming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/web-gaming/</guid><description>did you play browser games when you were younger?
i&amp;rsquo;m not sure if kids these days play browser games anymore.
but i&amp;rsquo;m talking websites like addictinggames.com,
stickpage.com, kongregate.com, and armorgames.com.
i would go on these sites after school in elementary
and just play random bullshit games for hours.
it was awesome.
you might have even heard of andyslife.org,
which is the secret site we had to use at catholic school</description></item></channel></rss>
