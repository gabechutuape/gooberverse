i&amp;rsquo;ve been consuming more podcast content, and i&amp;rsquo;m now
binging some episodes of This Past Weekend with Theo Von.
Theo Von is a comedian who, for some reason unbeknownst to me,
is quite popular and runs quite a popular podcast.
i&amp;rsquo;ve known of Theo Von from a Druski clip where he,
in the context of the appropriateness of saying the n word,</description></item><item><title>tanking it</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/tanking-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/tanking-it/</guid><description>you ever tanked some shit?
tanking something, per its roots in video games,
refers to enduring something painful and bracing for it
rather than attempting to avoid the thing or to gracefully
dodge the thing in some way.
you may be confused with something &amp;ldquo;tanking&amp;rdquo;,
which refers to when a thing fails miserably or
lowers drastically over time, like TV ratings &amp;ldquo;tanking&amp;rdquo;.
the tanking i&amp;rsquo;m talking about is the endurance one.</description></item><item><title>for the cold days</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/for-the-cold-days/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/for-the-cold-days/</guid><description>what do you like about winter?
winter is probably my favorite season,
despite the bitingly cold weather.
i think the temps give everyone something
to talk about without needing to be all
sweaty while lamenting our shared circumstances.
also, the cold brings everyone together.
i think everything feels a lot cozier when
it&amp;rsquo;s excessively cold. you start to appreciate
hot food and drinks more, warm clothing more,
and the indoors more.</description></item><item><title>the beauty of japanese curry</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-beauty-of-japanese-curry/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-beauty-of-japanese-curry/</guid><description>you ever have japanese curry? in any form.
katsu curry, curry udon, curry soba,
they all share one thing: the rich base.
the beauty of japanese curry is the fundamental
heartiness that it brings to your core upon
consumption. as is the case with all cultural
stocks, the flavor of japanese curry brings a slightly
tangy, salty, and filling mouthfeel that heats
your mouth down through your digestive system.
might not be the most beautiful way to word it,</description></item><item><title>watchlists</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/watchlists/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/watchlists/</guid><description>i feel like watchlists are a little bs.
&amp;ldquo;i&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to watch that&amp;rdquo;, or
&amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s on my list but i haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to it,&amp;quot;
are all convenient ways to try and push
a conversation in the direction of the media without
having actually consumed it to have a take on it.
i&amp;rsquo;m not innocent. i&amp;rsquo;ve done it before.
you can feel it socially, that you want the line</description></item><item><title>the joker</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-joker/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-joker/</guid><description>who do you think of when you think of &amp;ldquo;joker&amp;rdquo;?
it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a trick question.
notice how i didn&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;the joker&amp;rdquo;,
because i think &amp;ldquo;the joker&amp;rdquo; is definitely
always the Batman character.
when i think of &amp;ldquo;joker&amp;rdquo;, i usually think
of the main character of Persona 5;
the leader of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.
but some people think about the hit cardgame
Balatro, with its plentiful and unique &amp;ldquo;joker&amp;rdquo; cards.</description></item><item><title>when to feel bad about it</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/when-to-feel-bad-about-it/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/when-to-feel-bad-about-it/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve been having a bunch of coffee recently.
more than usual, that is. my usual is a single cup
in the morning, diluted halfway to the volume of
the cup with hot water.
as an aside, i&amp;rsquo;ve had great success diluting the coffee
brewed at work with water. it just.. tastes less strong
to where you can actually appreciate it a bit more.
anyway, i&amp;rsquo;ve been having a morning cup and an evening cup.</description></item></channel></rss>
