he always buys the no-pulp kind.
tropicana, costco, simply, you name it.
we&amp;rsquo;ve had them all in this house.
it&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that i associate with him
beyond all the other things he&amp;rsquo;s given me in this life.
between his brash impatience and his gentle compassion,
there are few constants.
but orange juice has always been in our fridge</description></item><item><title>living in your own bubble</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/living-in-your-own-bubble/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/living-in-your-own-bubble/</guid><description>sometimes you&amp;rsquo;ll meet someone that completely upends
what you know about the world and how people interact with it.
we all live in a bubble of our own design.
and it is certainly uncomfortable to leave the bubble.
the bubble is comprised of the things you like
and the things you find comfortable. it can be
your favorite game genres, the music you like to listen to,
the places you like to go, and the things you like to do for fun.</description></item><item><title>knowing but not knowing</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/knowing-but-not-knowing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/knowing-but-not-knowing/</guid><description>it&amp;rsquo;s so tiresome being an overthinker.
i claim anxiety. i do not shy away from its presence in my life.
and yet who am i to say whether it&amp;rsquo;s made me &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; for having
experienced and dealt with it.
all that i know is that it runs my brain ragged thinking about
people and relationships and how to do things and what the
&amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; thing is to do in any given situation.</description></item><item><title>art from the artist</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/art-from-the-artist/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/art-from-the-artist/</guid><description>increasingly in today&amp;rsquo;s AI-relevant world,
we as users of the internet must be diligent to
the dangers of consuming AI-generated content.
is what they would tell you.
they would tell you that to give in to it, to accept it,
would be giving up on the glory of the human soul and its
ability to create, inspire, and share with others.
however, to be quite fucking frank,
if i enjoy a thing, i&amp;rsquo;m good enough at separating the art from the artist.</description></item><item><title>the style of brevity</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-style-of-brevity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-style-of-brevity/</guid><description>i like to hold my blogposts to a certain standard of length.
for the most part, that is. sometimes they can be particularly long,
depending on how much i have to say about the thing, of course.
however, i find snippets about the lengths that you might read
as an adult swim intermission are the best length for conveying a message.
just long enough to say something,
but just short enough to not be tired of it.</description></item><item><title>a bug in uploading</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/a-bug-in-uploading/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/a-bug-in-uploading/</guid><description>for the beginning part of 2025,
i was unable to upload new posts to the gooberverse.
i couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand why this was the case,
other than seeing my github build and deploy would
invariably fail on new document submissions.
it turns out that with the help of AI,
they were able to detect a particularly sneaky
and irksome backslash that had somehow appeared
in the header bit of the .md files i was trying to upload.</description></item><item><title>put it into perspective</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/put-it-into-perspective/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/put-it-into-perspective/</guid><description>sometimes, talking to someone else is all it takes.
people just take comfort in knowing that what they&amp;rsquo;re saying
is being heard by someone. and it can be comforting in and of itself
to speak truly from the heart to one another.
there is no substitute for this. in fact, in any case where
one may believe themselves to have found a substitute for
genuine human interaction, they will certainly find themselves</description></item></channel></rss>
