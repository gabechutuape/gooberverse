he&amp;rsquo;s a youtube video essayist who makes commenataries on video games about things that are outstandingly mundane, like power lines in GTA 5, hydrology, and unemployment surveys.
i&amp;rsquo;m fascinated by his content. his cadence and pacing, especially, is uniquely captivating in its presentation. i&amp;rsquo;ve since exhausted his catalog of skyrim related videos, and found other skyrim video essayists EXTREMELY wanting.
something about them is just too nerdy to follow.</description></item><item><title>and yet over and over</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/and-yet-over-and-over/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/and-yet-over-and-over/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;m pretty bad with my sleep schedule.
i think i&amp;rsquo;ve written about this one before but it bears repeating because it is so pervasive of a problem for me.
how do you reconcile staying up because the rest of the world is up playing games and having fun with needing to be up the next day?
at some point, something has to give. i wonder when that time will come for me.</description></item><item><title>up and down</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/up-and-down/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/up-and-down/</guid><description>the cyclical nature of life can be amusing.
which sounds extremely unemployed, but despite everything, i am actually still employed.
the amusing part of it is how right now i&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure i&amp;rsquo;m in a downturn, and yet
i have a good feeling that things will turn around pretty soon..
not for any reason that should be considered ominous. it&amp;rsquo;s just hope.
when i first began doing things that were new to me,</description></item><item><title>being honest with yourself</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/being-honest-with-yourself/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/being-honest-with-yourself/</guid><description>there comes a time when you start realizing
just how many lies you tell yourself.
stuff like assumptions about way things work,
ways you think people interpret what you do,
ways you think things should go, and ways
you do the things you do.
one i&amp;rsquo;m recently trying to tackle is my perception
of the difficulty of &amp;ldquo;doing&amp;rdquo; things.
people say stuff like, going to the gym is &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo;.
but what if it weren&amp;rsquo;t hard?</description></item><item><title>my current favorite hoodie</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/my-current-favorite-hoodie/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/my-current-favorite-hoodie/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;m a big hoodie enjoyer.
i have a huge collection in my closet,
and it is my preferred top layer.
the usual issues i have with finding &amp;ldquo;good hoodies&amp;rdquo;
are that they need to meet certain criteria, namely:
a boxy silhouette (my chest is wide) slightly cropped, but not too cropped (my torso is short) arms that are nice and baggy but NOT too long (something that has a cuff that sits halfway on your hand is super ideal for the cozy vibe) a nice, structured hood that is big enough for my big ass head a heavy enough weight to conquer any morning when i feel like absolute garbage about the way i look a big enough kangaroo pouch/pockets to rest my hands in comfortably for a while, i was rocking Abercrombie&amp;rsquo;s relaxed popover hoodies.</description></item><item><title>fruitmaxxing</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/fruitmaxxing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/fruitmaxxing/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve been on a fruit kick lately.
apples, bananas, even some pears.
throw a few oranges in there too.
this stuff is honestly the shit.
sugar, carbs, fiber, all in a nice
little package that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel
like absolute dogshit for your body
to be consuming? sign me up.
i&amp;rsquo;m not sure when i fell off the
fruit bandwagon, but boy was i
an idiot for letting that happen.
it&amp;rsquo;s literally as the saying goes.</description></item><item><title>the doomed nature of napping</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-doomed-nature-of-napping/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-doomed-nature-of-napping/</guid><description>isn&amp;rsquo;t it a fucked thing,
to bear the consequences of a nap
so far after the initial mistake?
let&amp;rsquo;s lay down some ground facts here.
the initial mistake is definitely reaching a point
where you feel a nap is necessary. this could be
staying up too late, or eating too much food.
usually something excessive in some form has occurred
to feel as though you should humor a nap.
but here&amp;rsquo;s the thing:</description></item></channel></rss>
