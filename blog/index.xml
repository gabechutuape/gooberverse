(and also for a bit in college)
my two favorite albums of his were Under Pressure and The Incredible True Story,
his freshman and sophomore albums that hearken me back to the days
of driving my friends to off-campus lunch in high school, bumping &amp;ldquo;Stainless&amp;rdquo; in the car.
after he released the Everybody album to divisive reviews,
he underwent an extremely corny arc where all his music just&amp;hellip; wasn&amp;rsquo;t hitting the same.</description></item><item><title>deadlock and dota 2</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/deadlock-and-dota-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/deadlock-and-dota-2/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve recently been playing valve&amp;rsquo;s unreleased hero shooter, Deadlock.
my background is that i played a decent (400-600hrs) amount of overwatch/overwatch 2,
and a pretty good amount (~2000hrs) of Dota 2, Valve&amp;rsquo;s flagship MOBA.
i&amp;rsquo;m enjoying the game a lot! some of the visuals in-game are a little
rough around the edges, but for the most part, i like the aesthetic they&amp;rsquo;re going for.
i believe the name of the map is the Rotten Apple, in a kind of 50&amp;rsquo;s NYC vibe.</description></item><item><title>where i'm at with reading right now</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/where-im-at-with-reading-right-now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/where-im-at-with-reading-right-now/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;m on the 2nd to last chapter of Blood, Sweat, and Pixels by Jason Schreier, videogame journalist. i got to this point a week or so ago, and i was thinking &amp;ldquo;man, maybe i should just sit down and finish this book. there&amp;rsquo;s only two chapters left!&amp;rdquo;
but this year i&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking more about the reading process, and reading to have read rather than trying to really sit with a book.</description></item><item><title>headaches and substances</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/headaches-and-substances/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/headaches-and-substances/</guid><description>when you get a headache, what do you do about it?
growing up, i never used ibuprofen or acetaminophen to cope with headaches.
i just assumed they would go away eventually. also being a boy mean thugging shit out.
in my adult years, however, i have opened the pill bottle a good amount of times.
that being said, my initial reaction to a headache is still not to reach for a substance.</description></item><item><title>the hidden cost of transitions</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-hidden-cost-of-transitions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-hidden-cost-of-transitions/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking recently about the hidden cost of transitions between activities.
when it comes to filling your day with things that you can look back on and be satisfied with, one thing that happens regardless of activity or action is the transition between A and B. this can be anything from driving home to changing clothes to just simply mentally preparing yourself. deceptively, these moments are where the time you intend on dedicating to the actual activity can be stolen.</description></item><item><title>the beauty of online returns</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-beauty-of-online-returns/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-beauty-of-online-returns/</guid><description>are you an online shopper?
i make a fair amount of purchases online,
be it on Amazon, or clothing stores, or hobbyist sites.
to be honest, the convenience is simply unmatched.
i think about how much time i save having to drive to the store
or having to find a physical location in general for a thing i wanna buy,
and it feels so satisfying.
granted, this feeling of satisfaction is fueled by the dire</description></item><item><title>understanding the context of your parents</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/understanding-the-context-of-your-parents/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/understanding-the-context-of-your-parents/</guid><description>many times we can be rash in our judgments.
i, like many children, argue with my parents.
we have occasional conflicts in our ideas about life.
and i have come to understand that the context of their lives
are key to reaching an understanding of my own.
that is to say, sometimes they just get pissed at me
because they need something to be pissed at.
other times, i find genuine merit behind my parents' criticisms.</description></item></channel></rss>
