Persona fans are stereotyped into ignorant people
who, having consumed only Persona content, see stuff
that they think is from their games in other media,
and then they&amp;rsquo;re like whoa it&amp;rsquo;s just like persona
but in reality persona stole those things from them, etc.
it&amp;rsquo;s a useless exercise in what&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;derivative content&amp;rdquo;
among also having persona fans be people who are just</description></item><item><title>conflict resolution</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/conflict-resolution/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/conflict-resolution/</guid><description>you ever met a person who said,
&amp;ldquo;actually i&amp;rsquo;m great with confrontation?&amp;quot;
hell no, everyone is like &amp;ldquo;i&amp;rsquo;m really bad
with confrontation and its scary.&amp;rdquo;
i think confrontation is a necessary evil,
and the sooner you acknowledge that the sooner
you can get down to getting real value out of
raising your concerns to someone. i fear that what
happens to people who claim to be &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; with
confrontation is that they avoid it when in reality</description></item><item><title>fantasia</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/fantasia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/fantasia/</guid><description>in FFXIV the MMO, a &amp;ldquo;fantasia&amp;rdquo; is a cash shop item
that you can use to change the race and appearance
of your character, which is otherwise impossible.
FFXIV players can become &amp;ldquo;fantasia addicts&amp;rdquo; who
never truly settle on one race for their character,
spending tens of dollars on fantasias, never really
growing into an identity with their guy, and becoming
pretty much a shell of a person (derogatory).

nights by frank ocean? a legendary beatswitch.
what triggered this thought? i was listening to
the dandadan opening, which features
an almost ethereal beatswitch every other 1/4th of the song.
another famous beatswitch was Logic&amp;rsquo;s Under Pressure,
where he switches perspectives from his hustling self
to the perspective of a little sister writing a plea for help
to their brother, and a father wishing to reconnect with his son.</description></item><item><title>calm before the storm</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/calm-before-the-storm/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/calm-before-the-storm/</guid><description>the &amp;ldquo;calm before the storm&amp;rdquo; describes
the uneasy lull in pacing before a decisive moment occurs.
present in almost anything involving action,
the calm before the storm is a terrifying thing.
i deal with nerves in tense situations a lot.
and the calm before the storm is a thing that,
at first glance, you might think is a fine respite
preceding the storm which must occur. but you almost
grow to associate them with one another; that the storm</description></item><item><title>chewing the fat</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/chewing-the-fat/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/chewing-the-fat/</guid><description>have you ever heard of the term &amp;ldquo;chewing the fat&amp;rdquo;?
apparently it means to gossip or make small talk
or otherwise have informal conversation with someone.
my assumption was that chewing the fat would mean like,
we&amp;rsquo;re ironing out the kinks or something? or we&amp;rsquo;re going
through the shittiest, swampiest part of the thing we&amp;rsquo;re doing?
but no, it actually means having small talk. and surprisingly
the origin, on Wikipedia, is contentious: nobody actually knows</description></item><item><title>balloon and other dinky songs</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/balloon-and-other-dinky-songs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/balloon-and-other-dinky-songs/</guid><description>balloon by tyler the creator from his new album,
&amp;ldquo;chromakopia&amp;rdquo; is definitely a dinky song.
dinky songs are ones that sound like they&amp;rsquo;re being played
with tiny instruments or by dudes in goofy looking costumes.
they can generally be applied for comedic and diminutive effect.
a famous dinky song is that one dinky ass song from kirby.
i like to use dinky songs to calm myself down in tense situations,</description></item></channel></rss>
