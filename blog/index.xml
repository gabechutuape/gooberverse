honestly sparkling water is kind of a miss for me.
when i was growing up, my mom taught my brother and i
to practically never reach for soda in situations where
beverages were offered. we were always water guys.
this worked to our benefit, largely. it even set up a nice
failsafe system in that my tongue gets really easily
overwhelmed by the carbonation in soda (it hurts).</description></item><item><title>being quiet</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/being-quiet/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/being-quiet/</guid><description>do you think of yourself as quiet or loud?
when i was younger, i remember thinking that
people who were quiet were cooler than people
who were loud. i think it was a grass is always greener
situation for that, though. i had a mouth as a kid.
as i grew older, i got a bit quieter.
it was something i had to learn. when i met up with
some friends from elementary/middle school by the time</description></item><item><title>you are what you eat</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/you-are-what-you-eat/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/you-are-what-you-eat/</guid><description>have you ever felt the phrase,
&amp;ldquo;you are what you eat&amp;rdquo; feel like
it&amp;rsquo;s really the damn truth?
i don&amp;rsquo;t eat potato chips often.
but when i do, i almost invariably
feel like shit afterwards.
call my metabolic functions terrible;
some people can eat chips and it&amp;rsquo;s just fuel in.
no difference between that and anything else.
but for me, i get some chips in me
and i feel mentally sluggish,</description></item><item><title>winter dryness</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/winter-dryness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/winter-dryness/</guid><description>do you deal with dry skin in the winter?
dry skin, dry breath, dry everything really..
it&amp;rsquo;s the pits. for me, the coldness and shivering
that comes along with winter is something i accept
as a necessary step for the coziness that is warmth
from the interior of buildings and cars.
however, skin dryness just sucks. and i&amp;rsquo;m a victim.
it&amp;rsquo;s lotion all the time, face, back, arms, you name it.</description></item><item><title>hanging up christmas lights</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/hanging-up-christmas-lights/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/hanging-up-christmas-lights/</guid><description>you hang up your christmas lights yet?
usually we do ours on the weekend of thanksgiving,
but hanging up lights on the gutter outside is a two-man job
since it requires a ladder. as always, safety first.
i&amp;rsquo;ve got some gripes with christmas lights. first of all,
they break easy as fuck and as a result of the circuitry,
when one breaks, it&amp;rsquo;s a series connection, so like an entire</description></item><item><title>what makes someone easy to listen to</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-makes-someone-easy-to-listen-to/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-makes-someone-easy-to-listen-to/</guid><description>you ever think about what makes someone easy to listen to?
i&amp;rsquo;ve been consuming more podcast content, and i&amp;rsquo;m now
binging some episodes of This Past Weekend with Theo Von.
Theo Von is a comedian who, for some reason unbeknownst to me,
is quite popular and runs quite a popular podcast.
i&amp;rsquo;ve known of Theo Von from a Druski clip where he,
in the context of the appropriateness of saying the n word,</description></item><item><title>tanking it</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/tanking-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/tanking-it/</guid><description>you ever tanked some shit?
tanking something, per its roots in video games,
refers to enduring something painful and bracing for it
rather than attempting to avoid the thing or to gracefully
dodge the thing in some way.
you may be confused with something &amp;ldquo;tanking&amp;rdquo;,
which refers to when a thing fails miserably or
lowers drastically over time, like TV ratings &amp;ldquo;tanking&amp;rdquo;.
the tanking i&amp;rsquo;m talking about is the endurance one.</description></item></channel></rss>
