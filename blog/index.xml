for a while, it was a scary thing to have a label and put labels on things like
&amp;ldquo;how should the world be?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;how is the world now?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;what is my government doing?&amp;quot;
and understanding that taking a stance means you can&amp;rsquo;t have the benefits of all slices of the pie.

my first razer mouse was a razer naga hex, which was very useful when i was playing Dota 2 as it was made to accommodate the 6 slot inventory of potential active items in the game. after that, i had a deathadder elite original, but gave it up because i wanted more side buttons. the shape was something i would never forget, however.</description></item><item><title>are you who you are without your surroundings?</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/are-you-who-you-are-without-your-surroundings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/are-you-who-you-are-without-your-surroundings/</guid><description>i sometimes think about how we can tell who we are.
in the sense of, what things are there and how do i know i am myself,
and not somebody else who is taking someone else&amp;rsquo;s place in my body?
if you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell, imposter syndrome runs pretty deep around here.
but i hear that using your external surroundings is a good way
to reinforce who you are and what you do, at least in terms of</description></item><item><title>the idea of the two-day weekend</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-idea-of-the-two-day-weekend/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-idea-of-the-two-day-weekend/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about two-day weekends.
right now in society in america,
we abide by the two-day weekend.
you get saturday and sunday off work,
then you work monday through friday.
but the only real two-day weekend in my opinion
could possibly be if you had friday and monday off as well.
you see, in its current state,
saturday is spent recovering from friday
having been a workday already.
and sunday is spent worrying about</description></item><item><title>genuine dedication or utter foolishness?</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/genuine-dedication-or-utter-foolishness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/genuine-dedication-or-utter-foolishness/</guid><description>how long have you ever spent doing a single thing?
i don&amp;rsquo;t mean breathing. i mean something that requires active
consciousness and participation that you can&amp;rsquo;t do without trying.
something like writing a manuscript, or reading a book,
or doing something outside, or even doing work.
today, i spent 10 hours playing deadlock.
625 minutes is just over 10 hours. so.</description></item><item><title>what to do if the day sucks</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-to-do-if-the-day-sucks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-to-do-if-the-day-sucks/</guid><description>you ever go to work and just have an absolute poopoo day?
i&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how i self-medicate shit days.
usually it&amp;rsquo;s just indulgence in some form..
like ordering takeout or gaming or sleeping..
work today was kind of a bummer so i went to my local
boba place to get a mocha milk tea to get the vibes going again.
but it got me thinking,
should i just simply feel bad when it&amp;rsquo;s a bad day</description></item><item><title>in-game names</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/in-game-names/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/in-game-names/</guid><description>if you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with igns, or in-game names,
they&amp;rsquo;re a way to call someone in a game. their username.
or their character name. or their display name.
my first username that i can remember was Project_Star,
back on a korean mmo that i forget the name of (not MapleStory).
i used a lot of different names like Project_Silver, Project_WAR,
and in the present day, ProjectG (for gabe).
in-game names are fun because they&amp;rsquo;re what people choose most of the time</description></item></channel></rss>
