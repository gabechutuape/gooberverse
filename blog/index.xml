the melted, slightly salty flavor from the cheese,
the scent of broccoli wafting into your nose,
and the ear-to-ear warmth that a spoonful gives.
i recently rediscovered broccoli cheddar soup
at my local Potbelly sandwich shop on lunch break.
the first time i had broccoli cheddar was
my freshman year of college, six years ago.
i&amp;rsquo;ve never gone out of my way to purchase it,</description></item><item><title>coasting through the week</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/coasting-through-the-week/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/coasting-through-the-week/</guid><description>you ever phone it in for the day at work?
sometimes for me, that turns into an entire week.
the progress isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly.. critical.. so i never feel
particularly awful about not doing much when those times strike.
but it definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel great to just kinda do nothing
so i end up doing the bare minimum of everything to get credit
and then skating past it into the next week, hoping things will be different then.</description></item><item><title>political identity</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/political-identity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/political-identity/</guid><description>political identity is a complicated thing for me.
for a while, it was a scary thing to have a label and put labels on things like
&amp;ldquo;how should the world be?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;how is the world now?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;what is my government doing?&amp;quot;
and understanding that taking a stance means you can&amp;rsquo;t have the benefits of all slices of the pie.

my first razer mouse was a razer naga hex, which was very useful when i was playing Dota 2 as it was made to accommodate the 6 slot inventory of potential active items in the game. after that, i had a deathadder elite original, but gave it up because i wanted more side buttons. the shape was something i would never forget, however.</description></item><item><title>are you who you are without your surroundings?</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/are-you-who-you-are-without-your-surroundings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/are-you-who-you-are-without-your-surroundings/</guid><description>i sometimes think about how we can tell who we are.
in the sense of, what things are there and how do i know i am myself,
and not somebody else who is taking someone else&amp;rsquo;s place in my body?
if you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell, imposter syndrome runs pretty deep around here.
but i hear that using your external surroundings is a good way
to reinforce who you are and what you do, at least in terms of</description></item><item><title>the idea of the two-day weekend</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-idea-of-the-two-day-weekend/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-idea-of-the-two-day-weekend/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about two-day weekends.
right now in society in america,
we abide by the two-day weekend.
you get saturday and sunday off work,
then you work monday through friday.
but the only real two-day weekend in my opinion
could possibly be if you had friday and monday off as well.
you see, in its current state,
saturday is spent recovering from friday
having been a workday already.
and sunday is spent worrying about</description></item><item><title>genuine dedication or utter foolishness?</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/genuine-dedication-or-utter-foolishness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/genuine-dedication-or-utter-foolishness/</guid><description>how long have you ever spent doing a single thing?
i don&amp;rsquo;t mean breathing. i mean something that requires active
consciousness and participation that you can&amp;rsquo;t do without trying.
something like writing a manuscript, or reading a book,
or doing something outside, or even doing work.
today, i spent 10 hours playing deadlock.
so.. yeah. but it was a hell of a saturday.
i had a great time.
thanks for reading today&amp;rsquo;s post.</description></item></channel></rss>
