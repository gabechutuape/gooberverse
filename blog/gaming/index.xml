i don&amp;rsquo;t mean breathing. i mean something that requires active
consciousness and participation that you can&amp;rsquo;t do without trying.
something like writing a manuscript, or reading a book,
or doing something outside, or even doing work.
today, i spent 10 hours playing deadlock.
625 minutes is just over 10 hours. so.</description></item><item><title>in-game names</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/in-game-names/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/in-game-names/</guid><description>if you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with igns, or in-game names,
they&amp;rsquo;re a way to call someone in a game. their username.
or their character name. or their display name.
my first username that i can remember was Project_Star,
back on a korean mmo that i forget the name of (not MapleStory).
i used a lot of different names like Project_Silver, Project_WAR,
and in the present day, ProjectG (for gabe).
in-game names are fun because they&amp;rsquo;re what people choose most of the time</description></item><item><title>saturday nights</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/saturday-nights/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/saturday-nights/</guid><description>it&amp;rsquo;s saturday night.
the boys are in discord, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to game.
what ensues is a tale of camaraderie, triumph, loss, despair, battle,
but ultimately, through it all, the best vibes of all time.
i invite you to listen to saturday nights by inoha,
in the commemoration of awesome saturday nights.
we don&amp;rsquo;t have that many, people!
thanks for reading today&amp;rsquo;s post.
let&amp;rsquo;s get it started.</description></item><item><title>deadlock and dota 2</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/deadlock-and-dota-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/deadlock-and-dota-2/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve recently been playing valve&amp;rsquo;s unreleased hero shooter, Deadlock.
my background is that i played a decent (400-600hrs) amount of overwatch/overwatch 2,
and a pretty good amount (~2000hrs) of Dota 2, Valve&amp;rsquo;s flagship MOBA.
i&amp;rsquo;m enjoying the game a lot! some of the visuals in-game are a little
rough around the edges, but for the most part, i like the aesthetic they&amp;rsquo;re going for.
i believe the name of the map is the Rotten Apple, in a kind of 50&amp;rsquo;s NYC vibe.</description></item><item><title>running it down mid</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/running-it-down-mid/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/running-it-down-mid/</guid><description>if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been in a situation where the goal is clear,
and you know with certainty what you must do to succeed,
yet you still choose to do something that&amp;rsquo;s not only
NOT what you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to do, but even the exact OPPOSITE
of what you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be doing,
you have &amp;ldquo;ran it down.&amp;rdquo;
running it down mid is a term that comes from MOBAs
like League of Legends and Dota 2, where there&amp;rsquo;s</description></item><item><title>in spite of logic</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/in-spite-of-logic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/in-spite-of-logic/</guid><description>you ever do something you know you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing?
i&amp;rsquo;m currently playing through Final Fantasy VII Rebirth,
a game with over a hundred hours of content inside,
but also holding the capability to be finished in under 30 hours.
my reason for playing this game is because i have a concert
for the FFVII Rebirth Orchestra this saturday the 17th
wherein spoilers for the game will be shown.
therefore, i need to complete the game as fast as possible</description></item><item><title>learning experiences</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/learning-experiences/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/learning-experiences/</guid><description>sometimes, you just gotta take it on the chin.
a lesson i&amp;rsquo;ve had to learn many times in life is that
things aren&amp;rsquo;t always going to go as planned.
and when they don&amp;rsquo;t, it&amp;rsquo;s important to persevere.
on the same side of that coin,
it is important to interpret your losses not strictly as negative,
but as learning experiences and as things you can learn from.
your losses become way more productive once you can do this.</description></item></channel></rss>
