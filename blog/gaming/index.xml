my first razer mouse was a razer naga hex, which was very useful when i was playing Dota 2 as it was made to accommodate the 6 slot inventory of potential active items in the game. after that, i had a deathadder elite original, but gave it up because i wanted more side buttons. the shape was something i would never forget, however.</description></item><item><title>genuine dedication or utter foolishness?</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/genuine-dedication-or-utter-foolishness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/genuine-dedication-or-utter-foolishness/</guid><description>how long have you ever spent doing a single thing?
i don&amp;rsquo;t mean breathing. i mean something that requires active
consciousness and participation that you can&amp;rsquo;t do without trying.
something like writing a manuscript, or reading a book,
or doing something outside, or even doing work.
today, i spent 10 hours playing deadlock.
625 minutes is just over 10 hours. so.</description></item><item><title>in-game names</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/in-game-names/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/in-game-names/</guid><description>if you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with igns, or in-game names,
they&amp;rsquo;re a way to call someone in a game. their username.
or their character name. or their display name.
my first username that i can remember was Project_Star,
back on a korean mmo that i forget the name of (not MapleStory).
i used a lot of different names like Project_Silver, Project_WAR,
and in the present day, ProjectG (for gabe).
in-game names are fun because they&amp;rsquo;re what people choose most of the time</description></item><item><title>saturday nights</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/saturday-nights/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/saturday-nights/</guid><description>it&amp;rsquo;s saturday night.
the boys are in discord, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to game.
what ensues is a tale of camaraderie, triumph, loss, despair, battle,
but ultimately, through it all, the best vibes of all time.
i invite you to listen to saturday nights by inoha,
in the commemoration of awesome saturday nights.
we don&amp;rsquo;t have that many, people!
thanks for reading today&amp;rsquo;s post.
let&amp;rsquo;s get it started.</description></item><item><title>deadlock and dota 2</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/deadlock-and-dota-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/deadlock-and-dota-2/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve recently been playing valve&amp;rsquo;s unreleased hero shooter, Deadlock.
my background is that i played a decent (400-600hrs) amount of overwatch/overwatch 2,
and a pretty good amount (~2000hrs) of Dota 2, Valve&amp;rsquo;s flagship MOBA.
i&amp;rsquo;m enjoying the game a lot! some of the visuals in-game are a little
rough around the edges, but for the most part, i like the aesthetic they&amp;rsquo;re going for.
i believe the name of the map is the Rotten Apple, in a kind of 50&amp;rsquo;s NYC vibe.</description></item><item><title>running it down mid</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/running-it-down-mid/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/running-it-down-mid/</guid><description>if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been in a situation where the goal is clear,

NOT what you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to do, but even the exact OPPOSITE

i&amp;rsquo;m currently playing through Final Fantasy VII Rebirth,
a game with over a hundred hours of content inside,
but also holding the capability to be finished in under 30 hours.
my reason for playing this game is because i have a concert
for the FFVII Rebirth Orchestra this saturday the 17th
wherein spoilers for the game will be shown.
therefore, i need to complete the game as fast as possible</description></item></channel></rss>
