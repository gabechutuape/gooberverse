is that people will view other people as NPCs.
alternate term for npcs is skinwalkers.
people who you communicate with as a human
and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like you&amp;rsquo;re talking to them
or that they&amp;rsquo;re consuming any information
that you&amp;rsquo;re relaying to them in that moment.
i&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a bunch of FFXIV ultimate raids
and partying with random people to do the game&amp;rsquo;s</description></item><item><title>the meaning of grimy</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-meaning-of-grimy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-meaning-of-grimy/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;grimy&amp;rdquo; feels like it sounds.
when someone does something underhanded,
with clearly identifiable ulterior motive,
(but we&amp;rsquo;re not talking anything criminal here),
that dude is being grimy.
slimy is a similar word that somehow
also sounds similar to grimy.
lying about something or making
a bad faith argument? absolutely
grimy behavior.
lying about how far you&amp;rsquo;ve made it in a
FFXIV raid? grimy behavior. but sometimes
you gotta do it because everyone else is</description></item><item><title>extreme focus (ultimate raiding)</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/extreme-focus-ultimate-raiding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/extreme-focus-ultimate-raiding/</guid><description>have you ever focused so hard?
so hard that you have to actively think
about replenishing your sucrose stores
inside your brain so that you can
continue doing what you&amp;rsquo;re focusing?
i&amp;rsquo;m currently doing a challenging raid
in FFXIV that requires constant focus
and i went for 5 hours today of just
straight mechanics after mechanics..
but it will all be worth it!
thanks for reading today&amp;rsquo;s post.
yes.. this is where my focus should be.</description></item><item><title>legend of zelda wind waker</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/legend-of-zelda-wind-waker/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/legend-of-zelda-wind-waker/</guid><description>remember the Nintendo GameCube?
the GameCube was host to many legendary Nintendo titles,
like Super Smash Bros. Melee and Mario Kart Double Dash.
however, if you ask me what was a standout hit from that time,
i&amp;rsquo;ve gotta go with The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker.
Link in Wind Waker, riding the King of Red Lions. in Wind Waker, you control Link as he navigates across the seas</description></item><item><title>i finished disco elysium</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/i-finished-disco-elysium/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/i-finished-disco-elysium/</guid><description>today i finished disco elysium!
it was a thoughtful and beautiful game.
easily my top 5 of all time.
in the beginning of playing this game,
i thought that the dialogue was unwieldy
and laborious to read, that it was somehow
something that &amp;ldquo;ought to be unnecessary.&amp;rdquo;
this was conditioning from the previous games i had played,
which, despite having narratives i can stand behind,
simply were not up to the standard of disco&amp;rsquo;s writing.</description></item><item><title>decisions decisions</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/decisions-decisions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/decisions-decisions/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot more Disco Elysium lately.
in the game, you play as a detective who is guided by his internal aspects,
like &amp;ldquo;pain threshold&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;reaction speed&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;visual calculus&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;inland empire&amp;rdquo;,
on your journey to solve the case of a hanged man and your retrograde amnesia.
it&amp;rsquo;s having me think a lot about how my self-talk works.
&amp;ldquo;volition&amp;rdquo; in this game is your ability to resist temptation,</description></item><item><title>web gaming</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/web-gaming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/web-gaming/</guid><description>did you play browser games when you were younger?
i&amp;rsquo;m not sure if kids these days play browser games anymore.
but i&amp;rsquo;m talking websites like addictinggames.com,
stickpage.com, kongregate.com, and armorgames.com.
i would go on these sites after school in elementary
and just play random bullshit games for hours.
it was awesome.
you might have even heard of andyslife.org,
which is the secret site we had to use at catholic school</description></item></channel></rss>
