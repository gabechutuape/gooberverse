that you can use to change the race and appearance
of your character, which is otherwise impossible.
FFXIV players can become &amp;ldquo;fantasia addicts&amp;rdquo; who
never truly settle on one race for their character,
spending tens of dollars on fantasias, never really
growing into an identity with their guy, and becoming
pretty much a shell of a person (derogatory).

gamers hate nerfs.
they love buffs.
..now there&amp;rsquo;s clearly more nuance to that
than just those two statements, but for the
most part, especially in PvE games, people
far more enjoy buffs than nerfs from gamedevs.
so why do developers nerf stats?
i have no idea. if i knew the answer to that,
do you think i would be writing a post like this?\
it blows. maybe they hate the way the meta</description></item><item><title>humans and skinwalkers</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/humans-and-skinwalkers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/humans-and-skinwalkers/</guid><description>an unfortunate consequence of protagonist syndrome
is that people will view other people as NPCs.
alternate term for npcs is skinwalkers.
people who you communicate with as a human
and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like you&amp;rsquo;re talking to them
or that they&amp;rsquo;re consuming any information
that you&amp;rsquo;re relaying to them in that moment.
i&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a bunch of FFXIV ultimate raids
and partying with random people to do the game&amp;rsquo;s</description></item><item><title>the meaning of grimy</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-meaning-of-grimy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-meaning-of-grimy/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;grimy&amp;rdquo; feels like it sounds.
when someone does something underhanded,
with clearly identifiable ulterior motive,
(but we&amp;rsquo;re not talking anything criminal here),
that dude is being grimy.
slimy is a similar word that somehow
also sounds similar to grimy.
lying about something or making
a bad faith argument? absolutely
grimy behavior.
lying about how far you&amp;rsquo;ve made it in a
FFXIV raid? grimy behavior. but sometimes
you gotta do it because everyone else is</description></item><item><title>extreme focus (ultimate raiding)</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/extreme-focus-ultimate-raiding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/extreme-focus-ultimate-raiding/</guid><description>have you ever focused so hard?
so hard that you have to actively think
about replenishing your sucrose stores
inside your brain so that you can
continue doing what you&amp;rsquo;re focusing?
i&amp;rsquo;m currently doing a challenging raid
in FFXIV that requires constant focus
and i went for 5 hours today of just
straight mechanics after mechanics..
but it will all be worth it!
thanks for reading today&amp;rsquo;s post.
yes.. this is where my focus should be.</description></item><item><title>legend of zelda wind waker</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/legend-of-zelda-wind-waker/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/legend-of-zelda-wind-waker/</guid><description>remember the Nintendo GameCube?
the GameCube was host to many legendary Nintendo titles,
like Super Smash Bros. Melee and Mario Kart Double Dash.
however, if you ask me what was a standout hit from that time,
i&amp;rsquo;ve gotta go with The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker.
Link in Wind Waker, riding the King of Red Lions. in Wind Waker, you control Link as he navigates across the seas</description></item><item><title>i finished disco elysium</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/i-finished-disco-elysium/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/i-finished-disco-elysium/</guid><description>today i finished disco elysium!
it was a thoughtful and beautiful game.
easily my top 5 of all time.
in the beginning of playing this game,
i thought that the dialogue was unwieldy
and laborious to read, that it was somehow
something that &amp;ldquo;ought to be unnecessary.&amp;rdquo;
this was conditioning from the previous games i had played,
which, despite having narratives i can stand behind,
simply were not up to the standard of disco&amp;rsquo;s writing.</description></item></channel></rss>
