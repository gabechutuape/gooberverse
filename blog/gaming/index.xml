my TOP clear screenshot, 11-21-24. if you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with why that achievement matters,
allow me to explain.
FFXIV Ultimates are a type of raid taken on by 8 players.
they are denoted as &amp;ldquo;Ultimate&amp;rdquo; as opposed to &amp;ldquo;Savage&amp;rdquo;,
which is a different tier of raid difficulty, or &amp;ldquo;Extreme&amp;rdquo;,
which is another different tier of difficulty.</description></item><item><title>island sanctuary</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/island-sanctuary/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/island-sanctuary/</guid><description>in FFXIV, there&amp;rsquo;s some content called &amp;ldquo;Island Sanctuary&amp;rdquo;,
wherein you receive an island all to yourself, and its your job
to build it up, decorate it, and generating money so that you
can claim all the cool glamours that are gated behind it.
you do everything from gathering materials for buildings,
scheduling manufacturing export schedules to make money,
cultivating plants and nurturing wildlife, and placing
building landmarks, workshops, and other buildings, all while</description></item><item><title>fantasia</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/fantasia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/fantasia/</guid><description>in FFXIV the MMO, a &amp;ldquo;fantasia&amp;rdquo; is a cash shop item
that you can use to change the race and appearance
of your character, which is otherwise impossible.
FFXIV players can become &amp;ldquo;fantasia addicts&amp;rdquo; who
never truly settle on one race for their character,
spending tens of dollars on fantasias, never really
growing into an identity with their guy, and becoming
pretty much a shell of a person (derogatory).

gamers hate nerfs.
they love buffs.
..now there&amp;rsquo;s clearly more nuance to that
than just those two statements, but for the
most part, especially in PvE games, people
far more enjoy buffs than nerfs from gamedevs.
so why do developers nerf stats?
i have no idea. if i knew the answer to that,
do you think i would be writing a post like this?\
it blows. maybe they hate the way the meta</description></item><item><title>humans and skinwalkers</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/humans-and-skinwalkers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/humans-and-skinwalkers/</guid><description>an unfortunate consequence of protagonist syndrome
is that people will view other people as NPCs.
alternate term for npcs is skinwalkers.
people who you communicate with as a human

or that they&amp;rsquo;re consuming any information
that you&amp;rsquo;re relaying to them in that moment.

when someone does something underhanded,
with clearly identifiable ulterior motive,
(but we&amp;rsquo;re not talking anything criminal here),
that dude is being grimy.
slimy is a similar word that somehow
also sounds similar to grimy.
lying about something or making
a bad faith argument? absolutely
grimy behavior.
lying about how far you&amp;rsquo;ve made it in a
FFXIV raid? grimy behavior. but sometimes
you gotta do it because everyone else is</description></item><item><title>extreme focus (ultimate raiding)</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/extreme-focus-ultimate-raiding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/extreme-focus-ultimate-raiding/</guid><description>have you ever focused so hard?
so hard that you have to actively think
about replenishing your sucrose stores
inside your brain so that you can
continue doing what you&amp;rsquo;re focusing?
i&amp;rsquo;m currently doing a challenging raid
in FFXIV that requires constant focus
and i went for 5 hours today of just
straight mechanics after mechanics..
but it will all be worth it!
thanks for reading today&amp;rsquo;s post.
yes.. this is where my focus should be.</description></item></channel></rss>
