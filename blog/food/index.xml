it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work to pry open.
when i was a kid, with my soft baby hands,
i wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to open crab legs and so i never
grew and interest in eating crabs even though
they&amp;rsquo;re a classic filipino food, the seafarers that they are.
as an adult now, i realize that inanimate crab shells
pose basically no threat to me and i can crack them open</description></item><item><title>exceedingly spicy food</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/exceedingly-spicy-food/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/exceedingly-spicy-food/</guid><description>how are you with your spices?
when i was a teenager i would fuck heavy with
getting super spicy flavored stuff and getting
things that were spicy just thinking it would be
&amp;ldquo;tastier&amp;rdquo; than mild alternatives, somehow.
could be anything from chip flavors,
to chicken wings and their sauces,
to bowls of ramen noodles:
if i could get spicy, i probably would.
as i&amp;rsquo;ve grown, and successfully having destroyed
my stomach and intestinal lining,</description></item><item><title>waiting to be served at a restaurant</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/waiting-to-be-served-at-a-restaurant/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/waiting-to-be-served-at-a-restaurant/</guid><description>you ever had a long wait for your food at a sit-down?
depending on the time you go, it makes sense.
lunch rush, or at a breakfast place maybe brunch rush,
the workers are gonna be busy and you won&amp;rsquo;t get it out
in like, 10 minutes. but ideally before 25 minutes, right?
i developed a new pang of self-consciousness while waiting
for my server to come take my order at a restaurant today:</description></item><item><title>the CCP</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-ccp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-ccp/</guid><description>how do you feel about CCP?
and i ain&amp;rsquo;t talking about the Chinese Communist Party,
i&amp;rsquo;m talking about Chocolate Chip Pancakes.
chocolate chip pancakes. i somewhat got into chocolate chip pancakes after
watching The Good Doctor because of all the Dr. Han memes
that were on Twitter, the show in which the protagonist,
Dr. Shaun Murphy&amp;rsquo;s favorite food is chocolate chip pancakes.</description></item><item><title>the iced capp of tim horton's</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-iced-capp-of-tim-hortons/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-iced-capp-of-tim-hortons/</guid><description>have you ever heard of an &amp;ldquo;iced capp&amp;rdquo;?
the naive among you may think,
&amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s an iced cappuccino.&amp;rdquo;
nay, i say. neigh.
the &amp;ldquo;iced capp&amp;rdquo; specifically refers to
the coffee-flavored dessert-like beverage
offered by Canadian fast food chain Tim Horton&amp;rsquo;s.
it&amp;rsquo;s a delicious concoction of blended ice
and the flavors of coffee (and actual caffeine to boot).
since Tim Horton&amp;rsquo;s is not commonly found in the US,
i haven&amp;rsquo;t had an iced capp since i went to Canada</description></item><item><title>noodles and company</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/noodles-and-company/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/noodles-and-company/</guid><description>you ever go to noodles and company?
went there today for lunch,
found out they have garlic bread
five pieces, as an appetizer.
the roasted garlic tortellini was my entree,
and i enjoyed the meal with my buddy jared.
i haven&amp;rsquo;t been to a noodles and co. since
back in university, where my usual order was
their bbq pork mac and cheese, which
was absolutely excellent. it has since
been replaced by a bbq chicken mac,</description></item><item><title>subway sandwiches are slop</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/subway-sandwiches-are-slop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/subway-sandwiches-are-slop/</guid><description>back in high school i used to get subway a decent amount.
i had friends who worked there who would hook me up
with their employee discount: 50% off anything.
an italian BMT footlong on herbs and cheese
for a measly $7.00? count me in.
one of them even told me a trick about asking for
oil on the sandwich before you toast it to get that extra
crisp on your meat choice.</description></item></channel></rss>
