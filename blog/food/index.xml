apples, bananas, even some pears.
throw a few oranges in there too.
this stuff is honestly the shit.
sugar, carbs, fiber, all in a nice
little package that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel
like absolute dogshit for your body
to be consuming? sign me up.
i&amp;rsquo;m not sure when i fell off the
fruit bandwagon, but boy was i
an idiot for letting that happen.
it&amp;rsquo;s literally as the saying goes.</description></item><item><title>chesters hot fries</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/chesters-hot-fries/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/chesters-hot-fries/</guid><description>have you ever had a bag of chester&amp;rsquo;s hot fries?
they&amp;rsquo;re one of my favorite snacks of all time.
the legendary bag design of chester&amp;rsquo;s hot fries. chester&amp;rsquo;s hot fries, distinct from the Cheetos line of products
from Frito-Lay, are a bag that was once priced at $2 only for
a 6 oz bag of chips shaped like fries, with a saltiness, crunch</description></item><item><title>crab legs as food</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/crab-legs-as-food/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/crab-legs-as-food/</guid><description>my thing with crab legs as food is that
it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work to pry open.
when i was a kid, with my soft baby hands,
i wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to open crab legs and so i never
grew and interest in eating crabs even though
they&amp;rsquo;re a classic filipino food, the seafarers that they are.
as an adult now, i realize that inanimate crab shells
pose basically no threat to me and i can crack them open</description></item><item><title>exceedingly spicy food</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/exceedingly-spicy-food/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/exceedingly-spicy-food/</guid><description>how are you with your spices?
when i was a teenager i would fuck heavy with
getting super spicy flavored stuff and getting
things that were spicy just thinking it would be
&amp;ldquo;tastier&amp;rdquo; than mild alternatives, somehow.
could be anything from chip flavors,
to chicken wings and their sauces,
to bowls of ramen noodles:
if i could get spicy, i probably would.
as i&amp;rsquo;ve grown, and successfully having destroyed
my stomach and intestinal lining,</description></item><item><title>waiting to be served at a restaurant</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/waiting-to-be-served-at-a-restaurant/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/waiting-to-be-served-at-a-restaurant/</guid><description>you ever had a long wait for your food at a sit-down?
depending on the time you go, it makes sense.
lunch rush, or at a breakfast place maybe brunch rush,
the workers are gonna be busy and you won&amp;rsquo;t get it out
in like, 10 minutes. but ideally before 25 minutes, right?
i developed a new pang of self-consciousness while waiting
for my server to come take my order at a restaurant today:</description></item><item><title>the CCP</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-ccp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-ccp/</guid><description>how do you feel about CCP?
and i ain&amp;rsquo;t talking about the Chinese Communist Party,
i&amp;rsquo;m talking about Chocolate Chip Pancakes.
chocolate chip pancakes. i somewhat got into chocolate chip pancakes after
watching The Good Doctor because of all the Dr. Han memes
that were on Twitter, the show in which the protagonist,
Dr. Shaun Murphy&amp;rsquo;s favorite food is chocolate chip pancakes.</description></item><item><title>the iced capp of tim horton's</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-iced-capp-of-tim-hortons/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-iced-capp-of-tim-hortons/</guid><description>have you ever heard of an &amp;ldquo;iced capp&amp;rdquo;?
the naive among you may think,
&amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s an iced cappuccino.&amp;rdquo;
nay, i say. neigh.
the &amp;ldquo;iced capp&amp;rdquo; specifically refers to
the coffee-flavored dessert-like beverage
offered by Canadian fast food chain Tim Horton&amp;rsquo;s.
it&amp;rsquo;s a delicious concoction of blended ice
and the flavors of coffee (and actual caffeine to boot).
since Tim Horton&amp;rsquo;s is not commonly found in the US,
i haven&amp;rsquo;t had an iced capp since i went to Canada</description></item></channel></rss>
