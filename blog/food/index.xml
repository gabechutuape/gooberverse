the naive among you may think,
&amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s an iced cappuccino.&amp;rdquo;
nay, i say. neigh.
the &amp;ldquo;iced capp&amp;rdquo; specifically refers to
the coffee-flavored dessert-like beverage
offered by Canadian fast food chain Tim Horton&amp;rsquo;s.
it&amp;rsquo;s a delicious concoction of blended ice
and the flavors of coffee (and actual caffeine to boot).
since Tim Horton&amp;rsquo;s is not commonly found in the US,
i haven&amp;rsquo;t had an iced capp since i went to Canada</description></item><item><title>noodles and company</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/noodles-and-company/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/noodles-and-company/</guid><description>you ever go to noodles and company?
went there today for lunch,
found out they have garlic bread
five pieces, as an appetizer.
the roasted garlic tortellini was my entree,
and i enjoyed the meal with my buddy jared.
i haven&amp;rsquo;t been to a noodles and co. since
back in university, where my usual order was
their bbq pork mac and cheese, which
was absolutely excellent. it has since
been replaced by a bbq chicken mac,</description></item><item><title>subway sandwiches are slop</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/subway-sandwiches-are-slop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/subway-sandwiches-are-slop/</guid><description>back in high school i used to get subway a decent amount.
i had friends who worked there who would hook me up
with their employee discount: 50% off anything.
an italian BMT footlong on herbs and cheese
for a measly $7.00? count me in.
one of them even told me a trick about asking for
oil on the sandwich before you toast it to get that extra
crisp on your meat choice.</description></item><item><title>restaurant appetizers</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/restaurant-appetizers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/restaurant-appetizers/</guid><description>what kind of appetizers do you get?
i really like places that just have a thing
that is the appetizer without paying for it.
i&amp;rsquo;m talking olive garden bread and cheese,
or mexican places with chips and salsa.
but when i do have to pay money, if i&amp;rsquo;m with
a bunch of boys i do like getting some wings.
if i&amp;rsquo;m at a ramen place i&amp;rsquo;ll usually get
some takoyaki, or if i&amp;rsquo;m at a sushi or</description></item><item><title>chipotle's smoked brisket</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/chipotles-smoked-brisket/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/chipotles-smoked-brisket/</guid><description>i had the pleasure of trying out chipotle&amp;rsquo;s new protein option,
a returner from years past: the smoked brisket.
if you&amp;rsquo;ve been following the gooberverse, you may remember
that i am a chipotle regular with a consistent order.
however, i am not immune to limited time offerings and the
supernatural pull they have on my humanity and its need to
feel included in the exclusive. far be it from me to defy it.</description></item><item><title>au cheval chicago</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/au-cheval-chicago/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/au-cheval-chicago/</guid><description>if you&amp;rsquo;re in the Chicagoland area,
i would recommend getting a burger from Au Cheval.
they&amp;rsquo;re a michelin-star restaurant that serves
specifically diner fare, but make it gourmet.
they&amp;rsquo;re best known for their burgers which feature
a sunny-side up egg, as well as their garlic aioli.
i took a neat picture of a spotlight at our table
that had a glass of water and some cutlery.
i forgot to take a picture of the actual burger.</description></item><item><title>broccoli cheddar soup</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/broccoli-cheddar-soup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/broccoli-cheddar-soup/</guid><description>broccoli cheddar soup is a beautiful thing.
the melted, slightly salty flavor from the cheese,
the scent of broccoli wafting into your nose,
and the ear-to-ear warmth that a spoonful gives.
i recently rediscovered broccoli cheddar soup
at my local Potbelly sandwich shop on lunch break.
the first time i had broccoli cheddar was
my freshman year of college, six years ago.
i&amp;rsquo;ve never gone out of my way to purchase it,</description></item></channel></rss>
