i, like many children, argue with my parents.
we have occasional conflicts in our ideas about life.
and i have come to understand that the context of their lives
are key to reaching an understanding of my own.
that is to say, sometimes they just get pissed at me
because they need something to be pissed at.
other times, i find genuine merit behind my parents' criticisms.</description></item><item><title>talking to people</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/talking-to-people/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/talking-to-people/</guid><description>how do you feel about being at parties with strangers?
do you go into it thinking it&amp;rsquo;s an exciting chance to meet new people?
are you anxious about having to answer questions about who you are?
every time i&amp;rsquo;m put in that situation, i wonder why i tend more to anxiety
rather than curiosity.
was it easier that way at some point in time? &amp;hellip;easier for who?
it&amp;rsquo;s quite relatable, actually.</description></item></channel></rss>
