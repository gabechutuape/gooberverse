&amp;ldquo;you are what you eat&amp;rdquo; feel like
it&amp;rsquo;s really the damn truth?
i don&amp;rsquo;t eat potato chips often.
but when i do, i almost invariably
feel like shit afterwards.
call my metabolic functions terrible;
some people can eat chips and it&amp;rsquo;s just fuel in.
no difference between that and anything else.
but for me, i get some chips in me
and i feel mentally sluggish,</description></item><item><title>winter dryness</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/winter-dryness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/winter-dryness/</guid><description>do you deal with dry skin in the winter?
dry skin, dry breath, dry everything really..
it&amp;rsquo;s the pits. for me, the coldness and shivering
that comes along with winter is something i accept
as a necessary step for the coziness that is warmth
from the interior of buildings and cars.
however, skin dryness just sucks. and i&amp;rsquo;m a victim.
it&amp;rsquo;s lotion all the time, face, back, arms, you name it.</description></item><item><title>hanging up christmas lights</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/hanging-up-christmas-lights/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/hanging-up-christmas-lights/</guid><description>you hang up your christmas lights yet?
usually we do ours on the weekend of thanksgiving,
but hanging up lights on the gutter outside is a two-man job
since it requires a ladder. as always, safety first.
i&amp;rsquo;ve got some gripes with christmas lights. first of all,
they break easy as fuck and as a result of the circuitry,
when one breaks, it&amp;rsquo;s a series connection, so like an entire</description></item><item><title>what makes someone easy to listen to</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-makes-someone-easy-to-listen-to/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/what-makes-someone-easy-to-listen-to/</guid><description>you ever think about what makes someone easy to listen to?
i&amp;rsquo;ve been consuming more podcast content, and i&amp;rsquo;m now
binging some episodes of This Past Weekend with Theo Von.
Theo Von is a comedian who, for some reason unbeknownst to me,
is quite popular and runs quite a popular podcast.
i&amp;rsquo;ve known of Theo Von from a Druski clip where he,
in the context of the appropriateness of saying the n word,</description></item><item><title>tanking it</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/tanking-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/tanking-it/</guid><description>you ever tanked some shit?
tanking something, per its roots in video games,
refers to enduring something painful and bracing for it
rather than attempting to avoid the thing or to gracefully
dodge the thing in some way.
you may be confused with something &amp;ldquo;tanking&amp;rdquo;,
which refers to when a thing fails miserably or
lowers drastically over time, like TV ratings &amp;ldquo;tanking&amp;rdquo;.
the tanking i&amp;rsquo;m talking about is the endurance one.</description></item><item><title>for the cold days</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/for-the-cold-days/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/for-the-cold-days/</guid><description>what do you like about winter?
winter is probably my favorite season,
despite the bitingly cold weather.
i think the temps give everyone something
to talk about without needing to be all
sweaty while lamenting our shared circumstances.
also, the cold brings everyone together.
i think everything feels a lot cozier when
it&amp;rsquo;s excessively cold. you start to appreciate
hot food and drinks more, warm clothing more,
and the indoors more.</description></item><item><title>the beauty of japanese curry</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-beauty-of-japanese-curry/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-beauty-of-japanese-curry/</guid><description>you ever have japanese curry? in any form.
katsu curry, curry udon, curry soba,
they all share one thing: the rich base.
the beauty of japanese curry is the fundamental
heartiness that it brings to your core upon
consumption. as is the case with all cultural
stocks, the flavor of japanese curry brings a slightly
tangy, salty, and filling mouthfeel that heats
your mouth down through your digestive system.
might not be the most beautiful way to word it,</description></item></channel></rss>
