and i must say, as we approach the colder
north american mornings of winter, there is no
fonder sight to see than the bathrobe.
the problem with getting out of the shower is,
of course, the change in temperature from your
presumably hot shower to the comparatively colder
ambient temperature of the bathroom.
in spring, summer, and fall to an extent,</description></item><item><title>the potentially awful valley of small talk</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-potentially-awful-valley-of-small-talk/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-potentially-awful-valley-of-small-talk/</guid><description>how are you with small talk at the office?
some people are excellent at it. usually these
are people who are either up to current events,
interested in some sort of easily common activity
like sports or movies, or are just generally
good at showing interest in other peoples' lives.
i feel like i&amp;rsquo;m not terrible at small talk,
but you ever get into a conversation with a guy at work</description></item><item><title>donuts for the workplace</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/donuts-for-the-workplace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/donuts-for-the-workplace/</guid><description>the great combiner, that which brings
all people of the office together: donuts.
visitors are in town this week (people who usually
work off-site but are mandated to visit monthly)
so i had the bright idea of buying donuts for them.
unfortunately i bought too few donuts, but my concerns
went noticed and were allayed by my senior coworker who
fixed the problem with one simple trick: buy more donuts.</description></item><item><title>backup plans</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/backup-plans/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/backup-plans/</guid><description>when at first you don&amp;rsquo;t succeed,
you gotta have a backup plan.
for me, backup plans are annoying.
after all, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it just be nicer
if things just worked first try?
today i intended on going to a brunch spot
but i made the grave mistake of going at peak hours
and decided a 30 minute wait wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth my time.
the backup plan in this case?
getting food at a place that had similar</description></item><item><title>the Tasmanian devil</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-tasmanian-devil/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-tasmanian-devil/</guid><description>my cousins were over recently for my mom&amp;rsquo;s birthday,
and one of their two year olds is a whirlwind of a human.
not only did they (not necessarily the two year old,
but including the parents of the two year old) show
complete disregard for any form of order in terms of
how things were arranged prior to their arrival,
but they also managed to leave the place in a state</description></item><item><title>the qk65v2</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-qk65v2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-qk65v2/</guid><description>after months of using the realforce r2 as my daily driver board,
i am back to using the qk65 v2 from qwertykeys.
i built this keyboard out using Sunny Side Up linear switches from CannonKeys.
these switches were chosen because i thought they were a
rather neat looking gag of a switch design; i was pleasantly surprised
at how nice they sound after lubing and filming.
honestly, probably my favorite linear of all time</description></item><item><title>internet issues</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/internet-issues/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/internet-issues/</guid><description>ask any person who spends time on their computer:
the worst thing ever is internet issues.
people don&amp;rsquo;t like feeling like they&amp;rsquo;re
not in control, unsurprisingly, and so
when it comes to catastrophic problems
that are basically strictly out of your
hands, internet problems take the cake.
restart the router? are there a shitload of people
using the wifi at your house? are you gonna have to
talk to a support line to get this shit fixed?</description></item></channel></rss>
