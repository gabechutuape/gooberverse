touhou is a japanese bullet hell video game series
with a shitload of lore (?) and a bunch of characters.
it apparently also has jazz and bossa nova music.
if i could describe touhou in one word, it would be &amp;ldquo;eternal&amp;rdquo;.
touhou has felt like it&amp;rsquo;s had its own corner of the internet
since i remember logging on to 4chan the first time in 2010.</description></item><item><title>just like don't worry about it</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/just-like-dont-worry-about-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/just-like-dont-worry-about-it/</guid><description>how anxious are you?
a lot of people are anxious nowadays.
myself included. i blame my parents.
it&amp;rsquo;s almost a damn personality trait
for my generation and beyond.
whether it&amp;rsquo;s getting worried about
assignments that are due, or work,
or how you look, or where you are in
life compared to other people, there&amp;rsquo;s
a lot of pitfalls of anxiety around us.
there&amp;rsquo;s a hidden power that i couldn&amp;rsquo;t
unlock until i grew up: and it was the power</description></item><item><title>sparkling water</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/sparkling-water/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/sparkling-water/</guid><description>are you into sparkling water?
honestly sparkling water is kind of a miss for me.
when i was growing up, my mom taught my brother and i
to practically never reach for soda in situations where
beverages were offered. we were always water guys.
this worked to our benefit, largely. it even set up a nice
failsafe system in that my tongue gets really easily
overwhelmed by the carbonation in soda (it hurts).</description></item><item><title>being quiet</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/being-quiet/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/being-quiet/</guid><description>do you think of yourself as quiet or loud?
when i was younger, i remember thinking that
people who were quiet were cooler than people
who were loud. i think it was a grass is always greener
situation for that, though. i had a mouth as a kid.
as i grew older, i got a bit quieter.
it was something i had to learn. when i met up with
some friends from elementary/middle school by the time</description></item><item><title>you are what you eat</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/you-are-what-you-eat/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/you-are-what-you-eat/</guid><description>have you ever felt the phrase,
&amp;ldquo;you are what you eat&amp;rdquo; feel like
it&amp;rsquo;s really the damn truth?
i don&amp;rsquo;t eat potato chips often.
but when i do, i almost invariably
feel like shit afterwards.
call my metabolic functions terrible;
some people can eat chips and it&amp;rsquo;s just fuel in.
no difference between that and anything else.
but for me, i get some chips in me
and i feel mentally sluggish,</description></item><item><title>winter dryness</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/winter-dryness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/winter-dryness/</guid><description>do you deal with dry skin in the winter?
dry skin, dry breath, dry everything really..
it&amp;rsquo;s the pits. for me, the coldness and shivering
that comes along with winter is something i accept
as a necessary step for the coziness that is warmth
from the interior of buildings and cars.
however, skin dryness just sucks. and i&amp;rsquo;m a victim.
it&amp;rsquo;s lotion all the time, face, back, arms, you name it.</description></item><item><title>hanging up christmas lights</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/hanging-up-christmas-lights/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/hanging-up-christmas-lights/</guid><description>you hang up your christmas lights yet?
usually we do ours on the weekend of thanksgiving,
but hanging up lights on the gutter outside is a two-man job
since it requires a ladder. as always, safety first.
i&amp;rsquo;ve got some gripes with christmas lights. first of all,
they break easy as fuck and as a result of the circuitry,
when one breaks, it&amp;rsquo;s a series connection, so like an entire</description></item></channel></rss>
