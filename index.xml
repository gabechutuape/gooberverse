on daylight savings time as a concept.
most people i know are like, &amp;ldquo;can we just
stick to one time? and just not fuck with it?&amp;rdquo;
i&amp;rsquo;ll admit i&amp;rsquo;ve never looked into the actual
functional purpose of daylight savings time
and instead assumed it was an antiquated thing
that probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any place maintaining
its own existence in the year of our lord 2024.</description></item><item><title>students and teachers</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/students-and-teachers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/students-and-teachers/</guid><description>i was thinking about this the other day,
you ever consider the education system
from the perspective of the teacher and
not as the student (as many of us were at one point)?
when i was a kid in elementary and middle school,
i always thought teachers had it in for me
or that they were singling me out for being
relatively innocuous.
turns out i was being an active obstruction</description></item><item><title>happy halloween</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/happy-halloween/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/happy-halloween/</guid><description>for a brief moment, i was fooled
into thinking that i was above the idea
of participating in halloween and giving
candy out to strangers.
like i had seen past the capitalist veil,
and realized that the occasion was bullshit
and i shouldn&amp;rsquo;t bother putting anything out.
it turns out, it&amp;rsquo;s at least somewhat
spiritually fulfilling to donate candy
to my local population, receiving nothing
in return besides the idea that i made</description></item><item><title>bathrobes</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/bathrobes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/bathrobes/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve had a bathrobe for a couple years now.
and i must say, as we approach the colder
north american mornings of winter, there is no
fonder sight to see than the bathrobe.
the problem with getting out of the shower is,
of course, the change in temperature from your
presumably hot shower to the comparatively colder
ambient temperature of the bathroom.
in spring, summer, and fall to an extent,</description></item><item><title>the potentially awful valley of small talk</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-potentially-awful-valley-of-small-talk/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-potentially-awful-valley-of-small-talk/</guid><description>how are you with small talk at the office?
some people are excellent at it. usually these
are people who are either up to current events,
interested in some sort of easily common activity
like sports or movies, or are just generally
good at showing interest in other peoples' lives.
i feel like i&amp;rsquo;m not terrible at small talk,
but you ever get into a conversation with a guy at work</description></item><item><title>donuts for the workplace</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/donuts-for-the-workplace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/donuts-for-the-workplace/</guid><description>the great combiner, that which brings
all people of the office together: donuts.
visitors are in town this week (people who usually
work off-site but are mandated to visit monthly)
so i had the bright idea of buying donuts for them.
unfortunately i bought too few donuts, but my concerns
went noticed and were allayed by my senior coworker who
fixed the problem with one simple trick: buy more donuts.</description></item><item><title>backup plans</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/backup-plans/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/backup-plans/</guid><description>when at first you don&amp;rsquo;t succeed,
you gotta have a backup plan.
for me, backup plans are annoying.
after all, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it just be nicer
if things just worked first try?
today i intended on going to a brunch spot
but i made the grave mistake of going at peak hours
and decided a 30 minute wait wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth my time.
the backup plan in this case?
