&amp;ldquo;animator vs. animation&amp;rdquo;?
it was a legendary youtube video in that era
of youtube videos back when people shared them
word of mouth (as opposed to like, tiktoks).
i was almost inspired to learn cs5 flash,
the animating software made by adobe that&amp;rsquo;s
featured in the video, wherein a mouse cursor
(the animator) fights a stick guy he drew (animation).
i miss the days of those classic youtube videos.</description></item><item><title>speaking that into the world</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/speaking-that-into-the-world/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/speaking-that-into-the-world/</guid><description>are you a believer in superstitions?
if you say something egregiously awful,
like, &amp;ldquo;i hope your mom doesn&amp;rsquo;t die over her vacation,&amp;quot;
they might respond with &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t put that into the world, man.&amp;rdquo;
it has some roots in superstition in the sense of
when we say things, they mean more than we perceive
in the extent of our perception in front of us.
spiritually, the words you let out could be far more</description></item><item><title>tiredness in the eyes</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/tiredness-in-the-eyes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/tiredness-in-the-eyes/</guid><description>how can you tell when you&amp;rsquo;re tired?
for me, it&amp;rsquo;s when my eyes have trouble blinking.
for many people, they would say &amp;ldquo;they can&amp;rsquo;t keep
their eyes open as easily&amp;rdquo;, but mine is actually
feeling a slowness in bringing the eyelids together.
i think it has something to do with staring at
computer screens basically all day. probably burning
my eyeballs doing that shit or something.
i&amp;rsquo;ve also been told hunger is a good sign</description></item><item><title>island sanctuary</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/island-sanctuary/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/island-sanctuary/</guid><description>in FFXIV, there&amp;rsquo;s some content called &amp;ldquo;Island Sanctuary&amp;rdquo;,
wherein you receive an island all to yourself, and its your job
to build it up, decorate it, and generating money so that you
can claim all the cool glamours that are gated behind it.
you do everything from gathering materials for buildings,
scheduling manufacturing export schedules to make money,
cultivating plants and nurturing wildlife, and placing
building landmarks, workshops, and other buildings, all while</description></item><item><title>everyday sunshine</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/everyday-sunshine/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/everyday-sunshine/</guid><description>it&amp;rsquo;s tough being a fan of the &amp;ldquo;Persona&amp;rdquo; series.
Persona fans are stereotyped into ignorant people
who, having consumed only Persona content, see stuff
that they think is from their games in other media,
and then they&amp;rsquo;re like whoa it&amp;rsquo;s just like persona
but in reality persona stole those things from them, etc.
it&amp;rsquo;s a useless exercise in what&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;derivative content&amp;rdquo;
among also having persona fans be people who are just</description></item><item><title>conflict resolution</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/conflict-resolution/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/conflict-resolution/</guid><description>you ever met a person who said,
&amp;ldquo;actually i&amp;rsquo;m great with confrontation?&amp;quot;
hell no, everyone is like &amp;ldquo;i&amp;rsquo;m really bad
with confrontation and its scary.&amp;rdquo;
i think confrontation is a necessary evil,
and the sooner you acknowledge that the sooner
you can get down to getting real value out of
raising your concerns to someone. i fear that what
happens to people who claim to be &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; with
confrontation is that they avoid it when in reality</description></item><item><title>fantasia</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/fantasia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/fantasia/</guid><description>in FFXIV the MMO, a &amp;ldquo;fantasia&amp;rdquo; is a cash shop item
that you can use to change the race and appearance
of your character, which is otherwise impossible.
FFXIV players can become &amp;ldquo;fantasia addicts&amp;rdquo; who
never truly settle on one race for their character,
spending tens of dollars on fantasias, never really
growing into an identity with their guy, and becoming
pretty much a shell of a person (derogatory).
