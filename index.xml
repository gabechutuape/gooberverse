like when someone says &amp;ldquo;on my mama&amp;rdquo;,
or &amp;ldquo;on the dead homies&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;on god&amp;rdquo;,
you ever wonder what they mean?
to &amp;ldquo;put it on something&amp;rdquo; means to lay claim
that what you&amp;rsquo;re saying is true, and if
you&amp;rsquo;re lying, then curse the reputation of
whoever is incited in the phrase.
the person who is incited implies the degree
of severity to which someone attests that</description></item><item><title>yep mmhmm yeah</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/yep-mmhmm-yeah/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/yep-mmhmm-yeah/</guid><description>what kind of conversation fillers do you use?
i like &amp;ldquo;right.&amp;rdquo; a lot, as well as &amp;ldquo;ahh.&amp;quot;
i&amp;rsquo;ll also throw in some inquisitive statements like
&amp;ldquo;i didn&amp;rsquo;t know that&amp;rsquo;s how that worked.&amp;rdquo; or
&amp;ldquo;wait, really?&amp;rdquo; that one is huge.
it can be hard sometimes to keep up in
the deep technical conversations that
happen at my workplace, so it&amp;rsquo;s a skill
i&amp;rsquo;ve had to work on for a bit now.</description></item><item><title>post-exam feeling</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/post-exam-feeling/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/post-exam-feeling/</guid><description>do you remember taking exams in school?
didn&amp;rsquo;t have to be in university,
we don&amp;rsquo;t discriminate against education levels
around these parts.
but for me, the standout ones DID happen
to be when i was at university, because man
those exams had hands and i was caught lacking.
but pass or fail, with exams, the best part is:
when they&amp;rsquo;re done, they&amp;rsquo;re done. once you turn them in,
it&amp;rsquo;s out of your hands and you can stop worrying.</description></item><item><title>humans and skinwalkers</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/humans-and-skinwalkers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/humans-and-skinwalkers/</guid><description>an unfortunate consequence of protagonist syndrome
is that people will view other people as NPCs.
alternate term for npcs is skinwalkers.
people who you communicate with as a human
and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like you&amp;rsquo;re talking to them
or that they&amp;rsquo;re consuming any information
that you&amp;rsquo;re relaying to them in that moment.

when someone does something underhanded,
with clearly identifiable ulterior motive,
(but we&amp;rsquo;re not talking anything criminal here),
that dude is being grimy.
slimy is a similar word that somehow
also sounds similar to grimy.
lying about something or making
a bad faith argument? absolutely
grimy behavior.
lying about how far you&amp;rsquo;ve made it in a
FFXIV raid? grimy behavior. but sometimes
you gotta do it because everyone else is</description></item><item><title>extreme focus (ultimate raiding)</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/extreme-focus-ultimate-raiding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/extreme-focus-ultimate-raiding/</guid><description>have you ever focused so hard?
so hard that you have to actively think
about replenishing your sucrose stores
inside your brain so that you can
continue doing what you&amp;rsquo;re focusing?
i&amp;rsquo;m currently doing a challenging raid
in FFXIV that requires constant focus
and i went for 5 hours today of just
straight mechanics after mechanics..
but it will all be worth it!
thanks for reading today&amp;rsquo;s post.
yes.. this is where my focus should be.</description></item><item><title>theoretical and practical</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/theoretical-and-practical/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/theoretical-and-practical/</guid><description>in the world of Warhammer 40k,
there is a man called Roboute Guilliman.
(pronounced roo-boot, gill-ih-man)
Guilliman is a master strategist and leader of men,
revered for his universal pragmatism and resourcefulness.
one of his famed thought practices is the
&amp;ldquo;theoretical, practical&amp;rdquo; approach to problem-solving.
the process goes like this: state a problem you have
as the &amp;ldquo;theoretical&amp;rdquo;. then, name states of reality or
solutions pertaining to the problem that you can accomplish.</description></item></channel></rss>
