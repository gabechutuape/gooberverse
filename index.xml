the naive among you may think,
&amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s an iced cappuccino.&amp;rdquo;
nay, i say. neigh.
the &amp;ldquo;iced capp&amp;rdquo; specifically refers to
the coffee-flavored dessert-like beverage
offered by Canadian fast food chain Tim Horton&amp;rsquo;s.
it&amp;rsquo;s a delicious concoction of blended ice
and the flavors of coffee (and actual caffeine to boot).
since Tim Horton&amp;rsquo;s is not commonly found in the US,
i haven&amp;rsquo;t had an iced capp since i went to Canada</description></item><item><title>noodles and company</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/noodles-and-company/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/noodles-and-company/</guid><description>you ever go to noodles and company?
went there today for lunch,
found out they have garlic bread
five pieces, as an appetizer.
the roasted garlic tortellini was my entree,
and i enjoyed the meal with my buddy jared.
i haven&amp;rsquo;t been to a noodles and co. since
back in university, where my usual order was
their bbq pork mac and cheese, which
was absolutely excellent. it has since
been replaced by a bbq chicken mac,</description></item><item><title>i finished disco elysium</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/i-finished-disco-elysium/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/i-finished-disco-elysium/</guid><description>today i finished disco elysium!
it was a thoughtful and beautiful game.
easily my top 5 of all time.
in the beginning of playing this game,
i thought that the dialogue was unwieldy
and laborious to read, that it was somehow
something that &amp;ldquo;ought to be unnecessary.&amp;rdquo;
this was conditioning from the previous games i had played,
which, despite having narratives i can stand behind,
simply were not up to the standard of disco&amp;rsquo;s writing.</description></item><item><title>subway sandwiches are slop</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/subway-sandwiches-are-slop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/subway-sandwiches-are-slop/</guid><description>back in high school i used to get subway a decent amount.
i had friends who worked there who would hook me up
with their employee discount: 50% off anything.
an italian BMT footlong on herbs and cheese
for a measly $7.00? count me in.
one of them even told me a trick about asking for
oil on the sandwich before you toast it to get that extra
crisp on your meat choice.</description></item><item><title>decisions decisions</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/decisions-decisions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/decisions-decisions/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot more Disco Elysium lately.
in the game, you play as a detective who is guided by his internal aspects,
like &amp;ldquo;pain threshold&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;reaction speed&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;visual calculus&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;inland empire&amp;rdquo;,
on your journey to solve the case of a hanged man and your retrograde amnesia.
it&amp;rsquo;s having me think a lot about how my self-talk works.
&amp;ldquo;volition&amp;rdquo; in this game is your ability to resist temptation,</description></item><item><title>sunscreen application</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/sunscreen-application/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/sunscreen-application/</guid><description>they say a lot of stuff about putting on sunscreen.
like how you should put on sunscreen basically every day,
or how you should put sunscreen on even if there are clouds,
and how the &amp;ldquo;repercussions are sooo terrible!!&amp;rdquo;
this is one of those things where i accept it
as a fact of life that i&amp;rsquo;m not in the stage where
i&amp;rsquo;m willing to accept that shit as an active</description></item><item><title>restaurant appetizers</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/restaurant-appetizers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/restaurant-appetizers/</guid><description>what kind of appetizers do you get?
i really like places that just have a thing
that is the appetizer without paying for it.
i&amp;rsquo;m talking olive garden bread and cheese,
or mexican places with chips and salsa.
but when i do have to pay money, if i&amp;rsquo;m with
a bunch of boys i do like getting some wings.
if i&amp;rsquo;m at a ramen place i&amp;rsquo;ll usually get
some takoyaki, or if i&amp;rsquo;m at a sushi or</description></item></channel></rss>
