more than usual, that is. my usual is a single cup
in the morning, diluted halfway to the volume of
the cup with hot water.
as an aside, i&amp;rsquo;ve had great success diluting the coffee
brewed at work with water. it just.. tastes less strong
to where you can actually appreciate it a bit more.
anyway, i&amp;rsquo;ve been having a morning cup and an evening cup.</description></item><item><title>phoning it in</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/phoning-it-in/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/phoning-it-in/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;phoning it in&amp;rdquo; is a hilarious term to me.
do i know the etymology of it? no, but
i like to believe that sayings like this
that i don&amp;rsquo;t know the origin of can reach
new ceilings of potential hilarity from
the headcanon i can assign to it.
for example, the reason i know what &amp;ldquo;phoning it in&amp;rdquo;

pausing before you speak can really be
powerful beyond what you might think it accomplishes.
i mean, i&amp;rsquo;m 24. sure, it sounds kind of
ridiculous to be making this discovery at my age
as opposed to like, 12 years old. but i&amp;rsquo;d say
the best lessons are ones you learn for yourself.
nothing beats a primary source, after all.
so in listening to one of my new higher-ups,</description></item><item><title>political content consumption</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/political-content-consumption/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/political-content-consumption/</guid><description>do you have anything in your life
that you thought you would never get into
but one day, that all changed?
this most recent presidential election has me
more interested in consuming political content
to a degree far greater than ever before in my life.
that is also to say, i used to be of the mind
that political discussion would simply forever be
outside of my wheelhouse and that everyone having</description></item><item><title>complacency in performance</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/complacency-in-performance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/complacency-in-performance/</guid><description>if you learn how to do something,
have you ever noticed how it feels like
you get a little &amp;ldquo;worse&amp;rdquo; at it?
when you accomplish a hard thing and finally
reach your goal, if you want to do that same thing
again you end up not being able to meet that
expectation despite having provably done it before.
what happened? subconsciously, you got complacent.

the most in moments when it&amp;rsquo;s probably
inappropriate for you to be sleeping there.
like at work,
or during lecture,
or while you&amp;rsquo;re waiting for something,
and it can never be when you can just..
sleep a little.
maybe this is just a me thing.
it&amp;rsquo;s largely solved by just sleeping enough at night
and not doing things that are boring or uninteresting.</description></item><item><title>clearing the omega protocol</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/clearing-the-omega-protocol/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/clearing-the-omega-protocol/</guid><description>today, i cleared The Omega Protocol (Ultimate) in FFXIV.
my TOP clear screenshot, 11-21-24. if you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with why that achievement matters,
allow me to explain.
FFXIV Ultimates are a type of raid taken on by 8 players.
they are denoted as &amp;ldquo;Ultimate&amp;rdquo; as opposed to &amp;ldquo;Savage&amp;rdquo;,
which is a different tier of raid difficulty, or &amp;ldquo;Extreme&amp;rdquo;,
which is another different tier of difficulty.</description></item></channel></rss>
