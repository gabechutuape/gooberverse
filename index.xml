wherein you receive an island all to yourself, and its your job
to build it up, decorate it, and generating money so that you
can claim all the cool glamours that are gated behind it.
you do everything from gathering materials for buildings,
scheduling manufacturing export schedules to make money,
cultivating plants and nurturing wildlife, and placing
building landmarks, workshops, and other buildings, all while</description></item><item><title>everyday sunshine</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/everyday-sunshine/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/everyday-sunshine/</guid><description>it&amp;rsquo;s tough being a fan of the &amp;ldquo;Persona&amp;rdquo; series.
Persona fans are stereotyped into ignorant people
who, having consumed only Persona content, see stuff
that they think is from their games in other media,
and then they&amp;rsquo;re like whoa it&amp;rsquo;s just like persona
but in reality persona stole those things from them, etc.
it&amp;rsquo;s a useless exercise in what&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;derivative content&amp;rdquo;
among also having persona fans be people who are just</description></item><item><title>conflict resolution</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/conflict-resolution/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/conflict-resolution/</guid><description>you ever met a person who said,
&amp;ldquo;actually i&amp;rsquo;m great with confrontation?&amp;quot;
hell no, everyone is like &amp;ldquo;i&amp;rsquo;m really bad
with confrontation and its scary.&amp;rdquo;
i think confrontation is a necessary evil,
and the sooner you acknowledge that the sooner
you can get down to getting real value out of
raising your concerns to someone. i fear that what
happens to people who claim to be &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; with
confrontation is that they avoid it when in reality</description></item><item><title>fantasia</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/fantasia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/fantasia/</guid><description>in FFXIV the MMO, a &amp;ldquo;fantasia&amp;rdquo; is a cash shop item
that you can use to change the race and appearance
of your character, which is otherwise impossible.
FFXIV players can become &amp;ldquo;fantasia addicts&amp;rdquo; who
never truly settle on one race for their character,
spending tens of dollars on fantasias, never really
growing into an identity with their guy, and becoming
pretty much a shell of a person (derogatory).

nights by frank ocean? a legendary beatswitch.
what triggered this thought? i was listening to
the dandadan opening, which features
an almost ethereal beatswitch every other 1/4th of the song.
another famous beatswitch was Logic&amp;rsquo;s Under Pressure,
where he switches perspectives from his hustling self
to the perspective of a little sister writing a plea for help
to their brother, and a father wishing to reconnect with his son.</description></item><item><title>calm before the storm</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/calm-before-the-storm/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/calm-before-the-storm/</guid><description>the &amp;ldquo;calm before the storm&amp;rdquo; describes
the uneasy lull in pacing before a decisive moment occurs.
present in almost anything involving action,
the calm before the storm is a terrifying thing.
i deal with nerves in tense situations a lot.
and the calm before the storm is a thing that,
at first glance, you might think is a fine respite
preceding the storm which must occur. but you almost
grow to associate them with one another; that the storm</description></item><item><title>chewing the fat</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/chewing-the-fat/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/chewing-the-fat/</guid><description>have you ever heard of the term &amp;ldquo;chewing the fat&amp;rdquo;?
apparently it means to gossip or make small talk
or otherwise have informal conversation with someone.
my assumption was that chewing the fat would mean like,
we&amp;rsquo;re ironing out the kinks or something? or we&amp;rsquo;re going
through the shittiest, swampiest part of the thing we&amp;rsquo;re doing?
but no, it actually means having small talk. and surprisingly
the origin, on Wikipedia, is contentious: nobody actually knows</description></item></channel></rss>
