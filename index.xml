i know some people who can&amp;rsquo;t stand laundry,
and they need their s/o or somebody else to do it for them,
or they will otherwise do it with great mental stress.
for me, laundry is kind of relaxing.
it&amp;rsquo;s nice to set things and forget them,
come back later,
and see that they&amp;rsquo;ve made progress.

do you spend your money on things that have dubious practicality,
or otherwise applicability in your life?
i&amp;rsquo;m going through a pretty heavy mirrorless camera research phase..
if this sounds interesting, please look forward to the results!
but to the point, i rented a Fujifilm X-T30II for the duration of 7 days,
and almost convinced myself to buy the X-T50 before the X-T30II had even arrived!</description></item><item><title>lotion and preventative mindsets</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/lotion-and-preventative-mindsets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/lotion-and-preventative-mindsets/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve never had a &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; skincare routine.
in fact, i don&amp;rsquo;t even know what that would look like,
aside from the God of Skincare telling me &amp;ldquo;Yep, that&amp;rsquo;s it. You&amp;rsquo;re doing everything right.&amp;rdquo;
i keep it pretty simple,
just Cetaphil lotion (i tried cerave, my skin likes Cetaphil more)
and daily facial cleansing.
but i&amp;rsquo;ve had my fair share of back acne issues
as a result of my proclivity to perspiration.</description></item><item><title>how to unlock shadow the hedgehog in ssbb</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/how-to-unlock-shadow-the-hedgehog-in-ssbb/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/how-to-unlock-shadow-the-hedgehog-in-ssbb/</guid><description>do you remember those stupid videos
where people would be like &amp;ldquo;how to unlock shadow in smash bros&amp;rdquo;
and it would say you had to do multi-man smash on hard

and people fell for it?
i just randomly remembered those videos today.

or just milk tea in general?
milk tea is in a weird spot for me as this thing that somehow people view as far more socially acceptable to drink than other similar sweet drinks that are probably outright considered desserts instead of whatever half-category milk teas have carved out for themselves, and it&amp;rsquo;s just interesting to me how far the words &amp;ldquo;milk&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;tea&amp;rdquo; go to carry the elusive nature of their nutrition.</description></item><item><title>the every day</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-every-day/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-every-day/</guid><description>when you think of everyday things, what do you think of?

a familiar sight is my mom&amp;rsquo;s teacup, usually found sitting on the dining table or the living room table.
(and occasionally the kitchen countertop when she forgets to bring it upstairs.)
my mom&amp;rsquo;s preferred mug. usually contains green tea.</description></item><item><title>korean bbq is wonderful</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/korean-bbq-is-wonderful/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/korean-bbq-is-wonderful/</guid><description>have you ever been to a korean bbq place before?

we don&amp;rsquo;t go particularly often, but when we do, i always enjoy myself.

today, i&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing with you the recipe, that you may also enjoy it.

i mentioned i may one day get a camera of my own?
well, it happened.
sanukiseimen udon, at mitsuwa arlington heights. i got a minolta x-570, a camera made in 1983
as a low-cost alternative to the x-700.
it is revered for its strictly manual capabilities

strictly off of an audio or visual cue?
it&amp;rsquo;s interesting how pavlovian conditioning still holds up
to this day, for mammals as advanced as humans are.
using cues like these can help you build habits
like remembering to brush your teeth, or to drink water.
in my case, however, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit annoying.
it seems at some point i formed an visual/auditory cue</description></item><item><title>tagalog is an onomatopoeic language</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/tagalog-is-an-onomatopoeic-language/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/tagalog-is-an-onomatopoeic-language/</guid><description>tagalog is a fascinatingly onomatopoeic language.
to be onomatopoeic in this sense means that often
the words in this language are sonically descriptive
of what their definitions are.
for example: &amp;ldquo;kulimlim&amp;rdquo; is a word that means &amp;ldquo;cloudy&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;gloomy&amp;rdquo;.
and &amp;ldquo;bangga&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;collision&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;crash&amp;rdquo;, as in a car crash.
or &amp;ldquo;masaya&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;very happy&amp;rdquo;, and as you say the word &amp;ldquo;masaya&amp;rdquo;,
you may notice your mouth naturally opens to a smile.</description></item><item><title>breathing fresh air</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/breathing-fresh-air/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/breathing-fresh-air/</guid><description>never underestimate the power of some fresh air.
in general, taking a breather is a super good strategy
for tackling problems in the most effective way.
i&amp;rsquo;m sure this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time you&amp;rsquo;ve heard this advice.
but this certainly does not need to be the last time you hear it, either.
but specifically breathing air from a different place
than the one you&amp;rsquo;re currently in hits so massively differently.</description></item><item><title>napping can be dangerous</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/napping-can-be-dangerous/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/napping-can-be-dangerous/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve been engaging in naps recently..
i try not to nap whenever i can muster the willpower for it,
but with all these nights of playing final fantasy xiv,
i get up in the mornings and i&amp;rsquo;m like &amp;ldquo;fuuuhuuuck.&amp;rdquo;
and so, taking a nap after my mandatory morning meetings?
fucking hits like no other. so satisfying. it&amp;rsquo;s amazing.
and it&amp;rsquo;s goddamn dangerous.

but i&amp;rsquo;m not the best at staying hydrated.
sometimes i&amp;rsquo;ll get a dull headache and think,
&amp;ldquo;man this sucks. why is this happening?&amp;rdquo;
then i remember it&amp;rsquo;s been, oh, i don&amp;rsquo;t know,
four hours since i last drank water.
water needs no introduction. it&amp;rsquo;s the goat liquid.
they talk about getting a minimum amount of water per day,
but i&amp;rsquo;m pretty bad at tracking how much water i&amp;rsquo;ve drank.</description></item><item><title>haircuts are great</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/haircuts-are-great/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/haircuts-are-great/</guid><description>i love the feeling of having a fresh haircut.
all those days or weeks of building up to getting one,
and the anticipation of when you feel it&amp;rsquo;s just right to get one
is finally released.
for my asian hair, when it gets too long (for my liking)
it grows outwards pretty obtusely on the back and sides.
so i prefer having a taper fade of some kind to keep those sides short.</description></item><item><title>rainy days</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/rainy-days/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/rainy-days/</guid><description>how do you feel about rainy days?
i like rainy days a lot.
they enhance some kind of metaphysical coziness about the air.
and although it&amp;rsquo;s humid and a bit sticky at times,
the atmosphere sure makes for a good opportunity
to have a nice hot bowl of ramen noodles!
between driving in the rain, seeing the drops falling on your car,
or staying at home in the rain, hearing it land on your rooftop,</description></item><item><title>the mondays</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-mondays/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-mondays/</guid><description>does anyone like mondays?
i mean aside from like, david goggins i guess.
he probably also doesn&amp;rsquo;t like mondays but he like..
uses the fuel of people hating mondays to do MORE shit on mondays.
mondays are a complete struggle for me, as they are for many.

when groups of people go through the same slog of bullshit,
and they all know amongst themselves that none of them are enjoying it,
but they gotta do it because it&amp;rsquo;s a requirement for something else.
as you could have probably guessed by now,
my primary example is from final fantasy xiv.
in it, there was once this grueling slog of a set of dungeons</description></item><item><title>ordering food</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/ordering-food/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/ordering-food/</guid><description>are you the kind of person where when you eat out,
you always order the same thing from the same place?
i tend to do this a lot.
for example, my chipotle order is a:
bowl steak &amp;amp; fajitas white rice no beans queso corn mild salsa on occasion i&amp;rsquo;ll turn this into a burrito, but for the most part,
this is what gets the job done for me.</description></item><item><title>attention and hunger</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/attention-and-hunger/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/attention-and-hunger/</guid><description>do you ever lose your sense of hunger when focused?
i think it&amp;rsquo;s super interesting that this happens.
dr. k spoke about this once in the lens of ayurvedic teaching.
something along the lines of your attention being a limited resource,
like you have 100 attention points to spend on any amount of things at a time.
so if you manage to focus so intently on one thing,
you actually minimize the capacity to have your attention grabbed</description></item><item><title>changing things up</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/changing-things-up/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/changing-things-up/</guid><description>do you ever find it interesting how we feel the need to change things up every now and then?
as humans, we crave the new and get bored of the old..
such ingratitude. after all the times the old has saved our lives!
like when we brush our teeth! or remember to take our meds!
it could be a superpower in its own right to never get bored of something, couldn&amp;rsquo;t it?</description></item><item><title>priorities or otherwise</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/priorities-or-otherwise/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/priorities-or-otherwise/</guid><description>when i have problems justifying my current choices,

There&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as &amp;ldquo;not having the time.&amp;quot;
There are only priorities, and where they are placed.

although the quote is likely stolen from a source of his own,
the moments i spend pondering this idea are comforting.
indeed, his point is that when we tell ourselves we&amp;rsquo;d like to do something,</description></item><item><title>the realforce r2 keyboard</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-realforce-r2-keyboard/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-realforce-r2-keyboard/</guid><description>the current keyboard i use is the Realforce R2 Tenkeyless in the ivory colorway.
in the beginning of my keyboard journey, i started with a Leopold FC750R.
also a tenkeyless, but with mechanical switches instead of Topre switches.

and being confused as to why it was so expensive,
but still wanting the Leopold name behind my typing instrument of choice.</description></item><item><title>waiting in line</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/waiting-in-line/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/waiting-in-line/</guid><description>waiting in line is a divisive topic in my experience.
some people can&amp;rsquo;t tolerate it at all, while others look forward to making use of their time while waiting.
i knew a guy once who told me traffic was the most insufferable thing he had to deal with on a regular basis.
which is fair to him, i think his commute was something like 35-45 minutes every day back and forth.</description></item><item><title>the end of the day</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-end-of-the-day/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-end-of-the-day/</guid><description>what&amp;rsquo;s your ideal end to the day like?
one that&amp;rsquo;s particularly hard for me to beat
is taking a good dump after a long day of eating good food.
which might sound crass, but hear me out; it&amp;rsquo;s the ultimate relief.
after travelling and seeing the sights with your friends and walking around,
talking and eating food at restaurants you&amp;rsquo;ve never been to before,
you end up back in the comfort of your own home, your intestines churning.</description></item><item><title>being an npc</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/being-an-npc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/being-an-npc/</guid><description>i was thinking today about what it&amp;rsquo;s like being an npc.
in the figurative sense of being an npc with reference to other people,
and literally being an npc in like a video game or a movie or something.
