eventually, as you age, you require less sleep.
makes sense, metabolic function and all decreases
as you grow up since you&amp;rsquo;re not.. growing anymore.
i just never put two and two together that the
aches and pains that seem to persist because your
body isn&amp;rsquo;t recycling itself as quickly as it used to
was equivalent or in tandem with not getting more sleep.</description></item><item><title>ksi's thick of it</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/ksis-thick-of-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/ksis-thick-of-it/</guid><description>have you heard ksi&amp;rsquo;s new song?
people are clowning on it on the internet daily.
feedback like, &amp;ldquo;it sounds corny&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;KSI sucks&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;the song is trash&amp;rdquo;, etc etc.
well let me be the first to tell you:
it&amp;rsquo;s true. the song is corny. it sounds like
it came out in 2018 for the summer season.
which is not to say it sounds literally terrible
it just.. sounds quite generic. and also</description></item><item><title>nerfs vs buffs in game design</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/nerfs-vs-buffs-in-game-design/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/nerfs-vs-buffs-in-game-design/</guid><description>it&amp;rsquo;s a fact:
gamers hate nerfs.
they love buffs.
..now there&amp;rsquo;s clearly more nuance to that
than just those two statements, but for the
most part, especially in PvE games, people
far more enjoy buffs than nerfs from gamedevs.
so why do developers nerf stats?
i have no idea. if i knew the answer to that,
do you think i would be writing a post like this?\
it blows. maybe they hate the way the meta</description></item><item><title>putting it on something</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/putting-it-on-something/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/putting-it-on-something/</guid><description>you ever heard of putting it on something?
like when someone says &amp;ldquo;on my mama&amp;rdquo;,
or &amp;ldquo;on the dead homies&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;on god&amp;rdquo;,
you ever wonder what they mean?
to &amp;ldquo;put it on something&amp;rdquo; means to lay claim
that what you&amp;rsquo;re saying is true, and if
you&amp;rsquo;re lying, then curse the reputation of
whoever is incited in the phrase.
the person who is incited implies the degree
of severity to which someone attests that</description></item><item><title>yep mmhmm yeah</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/yep-mmhmm-yeah/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/yep-mmhmm-yeah/</guid><description>what kind of conversation fillers do you use?
i like &amp;ldquo;right.&amp;rdquo; a lot, as well as &amp;ldquo;ahh.&amp;quot;
i&amp;rsquo;ll also throw in some inquisitive statements like
&amp;ldquo;i didn&amp;rsquo;t know that&amp;rsquo;s how that worked.&amp;rdquo; or
&amp;ldquo;wait, really?&amp;rdquo; that one is huge.
it can be hard sometimes to keep up in
the deep technical conversations that
happen at my workplace, so it&amp;rsquo;s a skill
i&amp;rsquo;ve had to work on for a bit now.</description></item><item><title>post-exam feeling</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/post-exam-feeling/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/post-exam-feeling/</guid><description>do you remember taking exams in school?
didn&amp;rsquo;t have to be in university,
we don&amp;rsquo;t discriminate against education levels
around these parts.
but for me, the standout ones DID happen
to be when i was at university, because man
those exams had hands and i was caught lacking.
but pass or fail, with exams, the best part is:
when they&amp;rsquo;re done, they&amp;rsquo;re done. once you turn them in,
it&amp;rsquo;s out of your hands and you can stop worrying.</description></item><item><title>humans and skinwalkers</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/humans-and-skinwalkers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/humans-and-skinwalkers/</guid><description>an unfortunate consequence of protagonist syndrome
is that people will view other people as NPCs.
alternate term for npcs is skinwalkers.
people who you communicate with as a human
and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like you&amp;rsquo;re talking to them
or that they&amp;rsquo;re consuming any information
that you&amp;rsquo;re relaying to them in that moment.
