katsu curry, curry udon, curry soba,
they all share one thing: the rich base.
the beauty of japanese curry is the fundamental
heartiness that it brings to your core upon
consumption. as is the case with all cultural
stocks, the flavor of japanese curry brings a slightly
tangy, salty, and filling mouthfeel that heats
your mouth down through your digestive system.
might not be the most beautiful way to word it,</description></item><item><title>watchlists</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/watchlists/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/watchlists/</guid><description>i feel like watchlists are a little bs.
&amp;ldquo;i&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to watch that&amp;rdquo;, or
&amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s on my list but i haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to it,&amp;quot;
are all convenient ways to try and push
a conversation in the direction of the media without
having actually consumed it to have a take on it.
i&amp;rsquo;m not innocent. i&amp;rsquo;ve done it before.
you can feel it socially, that you want the line</description></item><item><title>the joker</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-joker/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-joker/</guid><description>who do you think of when you think of &amp;ldquo;joker&amp;rdquo;?
it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a trick question.
notice how i didn&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;the joker&amp;rdquo;,
because i think &amp;ldquo;the joker&amp;rdquo; is definitely
always the Batman character.
when i think of &amp;ldquo;joker&amp;rdquo;, i usually think
of the main character of Persona 5;
the leader of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.
but some people think about the hit cardgame
Balatro, with its plentiful and unique &amp;ldquo;joker&amp;rdquo; cards.</description></item><item><title>when to feel bad about it</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/when-to-feel-bad-about-it/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/when-to-feel-bad-about-it/</guid><description>i&amp;rsquo;ve been having a bunch of coffee recently.
more than usual, that is. my usual is a single cup
in the morning, diluted halfway to the volume of
the cup with hot water.
as an aside, i&amp;rsquo;ve had great success diluting the coffee
brewed at work with water. it just.. tastes less strong
to where you can actually appreciate it a bit more.
anyway, i&amp;rsquo;ve been having a morning cup and an evening cup.</description></item><item><title>phoning it in</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/phoning-it-in/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/phoning-it-in/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;phoning it in&amp;rdquo; is a hilarious term to me.
do i know the etymology of it? no, but
i like to believe that sayings like this
that i don&amp;rsquo;t know the origin of can reach
new ceilings of potential hilarity from
the headcanon i can assign to it.
for example, the reason i know what &amp;ldquo;phoning it in&amp;rdquo;

pausing before you speak can really be
powerful beyond what you might think it accomplishes.
i mean, i&amp;rsquo;m 24. sure, it sounds kind of
ridiculous to be making this discovery at my age
as opposed to like, 12 years old. but i&amp;rsquo;d say
the best lessons are ones you learn for yourself.
nothing beats a primary source, after all.

that you thought you would never get into
but one day, that all changed?
this most recent presidential election has me
more interested in consuming political content
to a degree far greater than ever before in my life.
that is also to say, i used to be of the mind
that political discussion would simply forever be
outside of my wheelhouse and that everyone having</description></item></channel></rss>
