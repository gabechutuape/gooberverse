my TOP clear screenshot, 11-21-24. if you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with why that achievement matters,
allow me to explain.
FFXIV Ultimates are a type of raid taken on by 8 players.
they are denoted as &amp;ldquo;Ultimate&amp;rdquo; as opposed to &amp;ldquo;Savage&amp;rdquo;,
which is a different tier of raid difficulty, or &amp;ldquo;Extreme&amp;rdquo;,
which is another different tier of difficulty.</description></item><item><title>crab legs as food</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/crab-legs-as-food/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/crab-legs-as-food/</guid><description>my thing with crab legs as food is that
it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work to pry open.
when i was a kid, with my soft baby hands,
i wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to open crab legs and so i never
grew and interest in eating crabs even though
they&amp;rsquo;re a classic filipino food, the seafarers that they are.
as an adult now, i realize that inanimate crab shells
pose basically no threat to me and i can crack them open</description></item><item><title>coping vs acknowledging</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/coping-vs-acknowledging/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/coping-vs-acknowledging/</guid><description>are you the kind of person who likes
to rip the bandaid off when it comes to
the bad news? or do you cope a little bit?
coping is a mechanism where you act like
things are better than they are because
to acknowledge that they aren&amp;rsquo;t would do
greater mental damage to you than you can
sustain at that given moment.
usually, when you cope, the longer you&amp;rsquo;ve
been coping, the worse it is when you rip</description></item><item><title>the chosen one</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-chosen-one/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-chosen-one/</guid><description>you ever seen the video
&amp;ldquo;animator vs. animation&amp;rdquo;?
it was a legendary youtube video in that era
of youtube videos back when people shared them
word of mouth (as opposed to like, tiktoks).
i was almost inspired to learn cs5 flash,
the animating software made by adobe that&amp;rsquo;s
featured in the video, wherein a mouse cursor
(the animator) fights a stick guy he drew (animation).
i miss the days of those classic youtube videos.</description></item><item><title>speaking that into the world</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/speaking-that-into-the-world/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/speaking-that-into-the-world/</guid><description>are you a believer in superstitions?
if you say something egregiously awful,
like, &amp;ldquo;i hope your mom doesn&amp;rsquo;t die over her vacation,&amp;quot;
they might respond with &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t put that into the world, man.&amp;rdquo;
it has some roots in superstition in the sense of
when we say things, they mean more than we perceive
in the extent of our perception in front of us.
spiritually, the words you let out could be far more</description></item><item><title>tiredness in the eyes</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/tiredness-in-the-eyes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/tiredness-in-the-eyes/</guid><description>how can you tell when you&amp;rsquo;re tired?
for me, it&amp;rsquo;s when my eyes have trouble blinking.
for many people, they would say &amp;ldquo;they can&amp;rsquo;t keep
their eyes open as easily&amp;rdquo;, but mine is actually
feeling a slowness in bringing the eyelids together.
i think it has something to do with staring at
computer screens basically all day. probably burning
my eyeballs doing that shit or something.
i&amp;rsquo;ve also been told hunger is a good sign</description></item><item><title>island sanctuary</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/island-sanctuary/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/island-sanctuary/</guid><description>in FFXIV, there&amp;rsquo;s some content called &amp;ldquo;Island Sanctuary&amp;rdquo;,
wherein you receive an island all to yourself, and its your job
to build it up, decorate it, and generating money so that you
can claim all the cool glamours that are gated behind it.
you do everything from gathering materials for buildings,
scheduling manufacturing export schedules to make money,
cultivating plants and nurturing wildlife, and placing
building landmarks, workshops, and other buildings, all while</description></item></channel></rss>
