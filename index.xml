i went today to the Victoria Theater to see
&amp;ldquo;Mass of the Fermenting Dregs&amp;rdquo;,
an indie japanese rock band touring the states.
i was in a party of 3, the other two of which
are one friend who is obsessed with the band
and the other who just really likes going to live shows.

minecraft parkour is an activity that describes
jumping around on blocks of varying distances
and heights while trying to avoid falling off.
when i was a kid, minecraft youtubers would
upload videos of themselves doing parkour maps
(among other custom minecraft adventure maps.)
they were fun to watch. i would spend hours watching
seananners, captainsparklez, bajancanadian,
and The Creatures. yeah, being 10 ruled.</description></item><item><title>fandom wiki sucks</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/fandom-wiki-sucks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/fandom-wiki-sucks/</guid><description>fandom wikis are so bad.
they are a fucking blight on the world of wikis.
instead of information, you get unskippable ad
banners that follow you as you scroll,
outdated information that&amp;rsquo;s poorly moderated,
shit-ass color schemes that burn your eyes,
and a content section that only takes up 50%
of the actual width of your screen.
can you imagine making a service that&amp;rsquo;s meant
to have optimal delivery of information</description></item><item><title>internalizing thought</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/internalizing-thought/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/internalizing-thought/</guid><description>disco elysium taught me about a new way to think.
this sounds stupid now that i&amp;rsquo;m writing it out,
but it&amp;rsquo;s more like disco elysium gave me a label
with which to apply to a pattern of thinking that
i&amp;rsquo;m sure i was already doing, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have a name for.
in the game, you have thoughts based on your interactions
and you can choose to &amp;ldquo;internalize&amp;rdquo; the more complex</description></item><item><title>the iced capp of tim horton's</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-iced-capp-of-tim-hortons/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/the-iced-capp-of-tim-hortons/</guid><description>have you ever heard of an &amp;ldquo;iced capp&amp;rdquo;?
the naive among you may think,
&amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s an iced cappuccino.&amp;rdquo;
nay, i say. neigh.
the &amp;ldquo;iced capp&amp;rdquo; specifically refers to
the coffee-flavored dessert-like beverage
offered by Canadian fast food chain Tim Horton&amp;rsquo;s.
it&amp;rsquo;s a delicious concoction of blended ice
and the flavors of coffee (and actual caffeine to boot).
since Tim Horton&amp;rsquo;s is not commonly found in the US,
i haven&amp;rsquo;t had an iced capp since i went to Canada</description></item><item><title>noodles and company</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/noodles-and-company/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/noodles-and-company/</guid><description>you ever go to noodles and company?
went there today for lunch,
found out they have garlic bread
five pieces, as an appetizer.
the roasted garlic tortellini was my entree,
and i enjoyed the meal with my buddy jared.
i haven&amp;rsquo;t been to a noodles and co. since
back in university, where my usual order was
their bbq pork mac and cheese, which
was absolutely excellent. it has since
been replaced by a bbq chicken mac,</description></item><item><title>i finished disco elysium</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/i-finished-disco-elysium/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/i-finished-disco-elysium/</guid><description>today i finished disco elysium!
it was a thoughtful and beautiful game.
easily my top 5 of all time.
in the beginning of playing this game,
i thought that the dialogue was unwieldy
and laborious to read, that it was somehow
something that &amp;ldquo;ought to be unnecessary.&amp;rdquo;
this was conditioning from the previous games i had played,
which, despite having narratives i can stand behind,
simply were not up to the standard of disco&amp;rsquo;s writing.</description></item></channel></rss>
