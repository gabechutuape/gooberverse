i&amp;rsquo;m not sure if kids these days play browser games anymore.
but i&amp;rsquo;m talking websites like addictinggames.com,
stickpage.com, kongregate.com, and armorgames.com.
i would go on these sites after school in elementary
and just play random bullshit games for hours.
it was awesome.
you might have even heard of andyslife.org,
which is the secret site we had to use at catholic school</description></item><item><title>chipotle's smoked brisket</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/chipotles-smoked-brisket/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/chipotles-smoked-brisket/</guid><description>i had the pleasure of trying out chipotle&amp;rsquo;s new protein option,
a returner from years past: the smoked brisket.
if you&amp;rsquo;ve been following the gooberverse, you may remember
that i am a chipotle regular with a consistent order.
however, i am not immune to limited time offerings and the
supernatural pull they have on my humanity and its need to
feel included in the exclusive. far be it from me to defy it.</description></item><item><title>recirculation road</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/recirculation-road/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/recirculation-road/</guid><description>you ever have to pick someone up from the airport?
skywalk near o&amp;rsquo;hare terminal 1 arrivals. shot with Fujifilm X-T50. are you the kind of person who spins the block via recirculation road
or do you just get parking and eat the $2-$5 cost of using it
for less than an hour and then leaving?
when i&amp;rsquo;m picking someone up who i know is quite punctual,</description></item><item><title>au cheval chicago</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/au-cheval-chicago/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/au-cheval-chicago/</guid><description>if you&amp;rsquo;re in the Chicagoland area,
i would recommend getting a burger from Au Cheval.
they&amp;rsquo;re a michelin-star restaurant that serves
specifically diner fare, but make it gourmet.
they&amp;rsquo;re best known for their burgers which feature
a sunny-side up egg, as well as their garlic aioli.
i took a neat picture of a spotlight at our table
that had a glass of water and some cutlery.
i forgot to take a picture of the actual burger.</description></item><item><title>broccoli cheddar soup</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/broccoli-cheddar-soup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/broccoli-cheddar-soup/</guid><description>broccoli cheddar soup is a beautiful thing.
the melted, slightly salty flavor from the cheese,
the scent of broccoli wafting into your nose,
and the ear-to-ear warmth that a spoonful gives.
i recently rediscovered broccoli cheddar soup
at my local Potbelly sandwich shop on lunch break.
the first time i had broccoli cheddar was
my freshman year of college, six years ago.
i&amp;rsquo;ve never gone out of my way to purchase it,</description></item><item><title>coasting through the week</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/coasting-through-the-week/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/coasting-through-the-week/</guid><description>you ever phone it in for the day at work?
sometimes for me, that turns into an entire week.
the progress isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly.. critical.. so i never feel
particularly awful about not doing much when those times strike.
but it definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel great to just kinda do nothing
so i end up doing the bare minimum of everything to get credit
and then skating past it into the next week, hoping things will be different then.</description></item><item><title>political identity</title><link>https://www.gooberverse.net/political-identity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gooberverse.net/political-identity/</guid><description>political identity is a complicated thing for me.
for a while, it was a scary thing to have a label and put labels on things like
&amp;ldquo;how should the world be?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;how is the world now?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;what is my government doing?&amp;quot;
and understanding that taking a stance means you can&amp;rsquo;t have the benefits of all slices of the pie.
