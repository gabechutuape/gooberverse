addiction.</p><p>a new one, not just the usual childish addictions like videogames and anime.</p><p>no, i needed an <em>adult</em> addiction that was so powerful that it carries with it<br>an air of haughtiness that blows away all who dare question its validity.</p><p>so i decided to get into coffee.</p><p>i decided to get into making pour-over coffee at home for a few reasons:</p><ol><li>coffee people are easy for people to give gifts to</li><li>making coffee every morning is a great way to build a habit routine</li><li>having a taste for coffee makes you seem like a cultured person</li></ol><p>i was going to do it: i was gonna be a coffee guy.<br>&ldquo;a roast from Colombia? i actually prefer Guatemalan blends&rdquo;,<br>i would say brazenly and triumphantly, surely to the respect of my peers.</p><p>and i was definitely not going to use ANY kind of sweetener,<br>lest i ruin the epic sanctity of the art of the brew.</p><p>my older brother helped me get started; as a coffee person himself,<br>he had gear at our house that i could use while he was away,<br>namely, his <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Plastic-Coffee-Dripper-Clear/dp/B0BWHKPCLJ>hario v60 dripper</a> and <a href=https://www.amazon.com/HARIO-02-White-Paper-Filter/dp/B07DTR9N26>filters</a>, and a ceramic grinder.</p><p>he also gave me a single video, maybe one of the most legendary youtube videos<br>about coffee of all time: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oB1oDrDkHM">James Hoffman&rsquo;s V60 brewing recipe guide</a>.<br>i watched it, wrote down the recipe, and eagerly made a cup of coffee<br>every day before work immediately after waking up, at 5:30AM.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center><img src=/images/coffee.png alt="coffee cup"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><em>january 18th, 2023: one of the first cups i ever made.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>i spent a few months buying beans from <a href=https://revelatorcoffee.com/>different</a> <a href=https://catandcloud.com/>roasteries</a> <a href=https://onyxcoffeelab.com/>online</a>,<br>as well as trying recommendations from my cousin and brother,<br>all while writing down my taste perceptions in <a href=https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2023/pc/detail_cover/wb23_tnm/>a journal that i bought just for coffee</a>.</p><p>as my journey continued, i felt i needed more control over the brewing process,<br>and so i ended up buying more expensive gear:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BBVNSBXN>a better digital scale</a></li><li><a href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09DS4HVRQ>a more consistent stainless steel grinder</a></li><li>the legendary <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Fellow-Electric-Pour-over-Temperature-Stopwatch/dp/B077JBQZPX>Fellow Stagg</a>, a gooseneck kettle</li></ul><p>i even bought some <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Bodum-Bistro-Coffee-Ounce-2-Pack/dp/B00E2RU5TS>double-walled mugs</a> to really get a good look at my work.<br>all in all, my coffee setup was nearing the $600 range: quite a nice set of kit.</p><p>but by the time autumn that year rolled around, something changed:<br>i wasn&rsquo;t super happy about the coffee i was making anymore.</p><p>what was once a fun experiment that i recorded in my neat little journal<br>became another chore to think about and to worry about.</p><p>every morning, my coffee journal entries felt the same:<br>&ldquo;revelator: water temp 100c. grounds weight: 14.9g. score: 7.5.<br>bitter today, but nothing i&rsquo;m not used to. quite aromatic.&rdquo;</p><p>and every morning that i woke up late or didn&rsquo;t have time to make coffee<br>felt like a sting in what was supposed to be my efforts towards<br>proving to myself that i could build meaningful habits if i really tried.</p><p>not to mention, i was kind of expecting the caffeine to, oh i don&rsquo;t know,<br>help me feel more awake at work. but i guess i was expecting too much<br>of the poor beverage and <a href=https://www.wellandgood.com/coffee-first-thing-morning/>what little chance it had</a> against my sleep schedule.</p><p>it all just tasted more or less the same. it was scarcely eye-opening.<br>it definitely wasn&rsquo;t helping me feel more alert. as far as i was concerned,<br>the only thing it was definitely doing was stopping me from getting<br>a precious, <strong>precious</strong> extra 30 minutes of sleep.</p><p>and so, after enough missed days, i stopped writing in the journal,</p><p>i stopped making coffee every morning at home,</p><p>and i did what anyone else would do in my situation:</p><p>i just used the damn coffee maker at work and drank it with CoffeeMate creamer.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center><img src=/images/bloomfield.png alt="work coffee machine"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><em>the old-ass Koffee King we have at work.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>but my journey didn&rsquo;t end there.</p><p>after coming back from a trip to the Philippines in January 2024,<br>i was enlightened by the coffee i was served on Korean Airlines:<br>sweet yet roasty, that nice warm feeling, and a good size.</p><p>my dad was similarly intrigued, so we looked up the most<br>popular korean coffee available, only to discover that it is quite common<br>to make instant coffee in korea in packets that already contain<br>coffee grounds, sugar, and creamer: <strong>a 3-in-1 combo of excellence</strong>.</p><p>after exploring the most popular brand, Maxim, and its selection,<br>i landed on their <a href=https://www.amazon.com/MAXIM-SUPREME-GOLD-COFFEE-100pks/dp/B09Z7GKT1Q>Supreme Gold blend</a> as my preferred blend in the mornings.<br>i still recommend it to people if they ask me about coffee.</p><p>a single packet makes a latte size (around 3oz of water) drink,<br>and it&rsquo;s not a bitter piece of shit like the coffee i was making.<br>it&rsquo;s actually yummy. i look forward to drinking them.</p><p>was i just another sod who fell into the trap of addictive sugars<br>and convenience, as opposed to someone who found the beauty in<br>honing your craft and striving for the perfect cup?</p><p>wasn&rsquo;t i supposed to get an appreciation for the finer things,<br>and stand above the masses who lazily resigned themselves to their<br><a href=https://athome.starbucks.com/products/pike-place-roast-ground>generic, cultureless, devoid-of-soul morning brews</a>?</p><p>well, sorry, but i didn&rsquo;t. and i&rsquo;m damn proud of it.<br>i was being vapid and naive about &ldquo;taste&rdquo; and &ldquo;culture&rdquo;.<br>to be honest, i don&rsquo;t feel like i&rsquo;m missing out on shit.</p><p>maybe i wasted my time exploring coffee, or maybe i was totally just brewing wrong,<br>and maybe i&rsquo;m a fool for ending up right back at the top of the coffee iceberg<br>after all that effort of trying beans, recipes, water filtration, and grind sizes.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center><img src=/images/coffee-iceberg.png alt="coffee iceberg"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><em>at the peak of my hubris, i made it all the way to &ldquo;hates channeling."</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>i&rsquo;m ultimately glad to have had the experience of making my own coffee at home,<br>because i can confidently say that i&rsquo;m happy with where i ended up at the end:</p><p>as a person who just wants a yummy cup in the morning that&rsquo;s easy to make.</p><p>thank you for reading today&rsquo;s post.<br>better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.. right?</p></content><div class=content-container><div class=tags><a href=https://www.gooberverse.net/blog/habits/
