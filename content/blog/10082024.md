where were you when you heard the news about covid-19?

i was a sophomore in college,\
hearing rumors about some new viral infection\
that was rivaling the likes of influenza.

i remember being at my campus supermarket,\
thinking "hmm.. i guess i don't have any face masks.\
maybe i should buy some before it gets bad.."

it was just about to be spring break, too.\
i remember my parents telling me to stay at my apartment,\
because they're nurses who might get me sick.

it was a scary time to have nurses for parents.\
you think they're invincible because they work in medicine,\
but really, they're risking their lives every day.

my parents are going through a bout of covid right now,\
and i may or may not be catching it myself soon here\
(my throat feels a bit funny).

when people say they can remember "exactly where they were"\
when an incident happened, like hearing the news of 9/11,\
or learning a family member had cancer or passed away,\
i found it hard to believe because i didn't have a time like that of my own.

but it changed when covid-19 struck our planet.

thanks for reading today's post.\
memories..
