are you a believer in superstitions?\
if you say something egregiously awful,\
like, "i hope your mom doesn't die over her vacation,"\
they might respond with "don't put that into the world, man."

it has some roots in superstition in the sense of\
when we say things, they mean more than we perceive\
in the extent of our perception in front of us.

spiritually, the words you let out could be far more\
significant than you think. and i'm absolutely sold on that shit.\
it's all jinxes and stuff, but i buy into it. and maybe that's\
part of the problem, but when someone says "this'll happen"\
or they try and manifest it into existence, even if it has\
nothing to do with the event occurring causally, it just makes it feel\
1000x worse when the thing doesn't happen that they were hoping would.

i try to keep my mouth shut and expectations tempered.\
i find it more effective in terms of not being disappointed.

thanks for reading today's post.\
everyone, be quiet.
