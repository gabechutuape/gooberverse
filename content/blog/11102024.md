the "calm before the storm" describes\
the uneasy lull in pacing before a decisive moment occurs.

present in almost anything involving action,\
the calm before the storm is a terrifying thing.

i deal with nerves in tense situations a lot.\
and the calm before the storm is a thing that,\
at first glance, you might think is a fine respite\
preceding the storm which must occur. but you almost\
grow to associate them with one another; that the storm\
must naturally follow the calm, almost.

it can kind of get in the way of figuring out how\
to truly "relax" and not think that there's a storm brewing.

thanks for reading today's post.\
no answer for this one yet from me..
