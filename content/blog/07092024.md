how do you feel about rainy days?

i like rainy days a lot.\
they enhance some kind of metaphysical coziness about the air.

and although it's humid and a bit sticky at times,\
the atmosphere sure makes for a good opportunity\
to have a nice hot bowl of ramen noodles!

between driving in the rain, seeing the drops falling on your car,\
or staying at home in the rain, hearing it land on your rooftop,\
there's something about rain that makes me feel like saying,\
"oh! it's a limited time event right now."

as though i feel like pausing,\
to reflect and look at where i am at this point in time.

to the weather,\
the things going on in my life must seem so small.

and so the rain is a gentle reminder for me\
to do as Bruce Lee said, and be like water.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i keep an umbrella in my car for these occasions.
