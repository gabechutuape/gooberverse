sometimes you'll meet someone that completely upends\
what you know about the world and how people interact with it.

we all live in a bubble of our own design.\
and it is certainly uncomfortable to leave the bubble.

the bubble is comprised of the things you like\
and the things you find comfortable. it can be\
your favorite game genres, the music you like to listen to,\
the places you like to go, and the things you like to do for fun.

when you meet someone who doesn't fit into one of those things,\
frankly, that's how we learn more about the world.\
isn't it ironic that we need to be uncomfortable\
to gain access to further comforts and delights?

nothing ventured nothing gained.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i should take my own advice. maybe.
