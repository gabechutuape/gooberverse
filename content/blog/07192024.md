when you think of everyday things, what do you think of?

do you think of people? or of sounds? or of feelings? or of sights?

a familiar sight is my mom's teacup, usually found sitting on the dining table or the living room table.\
(and occasionally the kitchen countertop when she forgets to bring it upstairs.)

another familiar sight is my smiski collection, which is found on my computer desk.\
i've been growing them since the beginning of 2023, and it's fun posing them.

if you don't know what smiskis are, they're neutral-faced little glow-in-the-dark *dudes* who have various poses and props attached to them. i like them because they make my desk look a little busier. smiskis are pretty renowned as a desk tchotchke, and for my part, can be found at kinokuniya bookstore in arlington heights (a primary reason i visit at all is to see what new ones are in stock).

but maybe you don't think of sights..\
you could think of the feeling of a warm shower,\
or the sound of a loved one's voice.

you might think of starting your car to go to work,\
or of the feeling of taking a swig of water,\
or the feeling of sun touching your skin.

perhaps you imagine what it feels like to breathe,\
or the oily sensation on your face after a long day,\
or of the sacred and blessed time you spend on the toilet.

was this post just a drawn-out way of trying to promote pictures i uploaded to [my flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/201072478@N07/)?\
perhaps. at the very least, i hope you liked looking at the images.

thank you for reading today's post.\
let's do our best to find joy in the everyday.
