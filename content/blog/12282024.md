remember long weekends as a kid?\
those endless Saturdays..\
but they somehow went by too fast.

or semester breaks in general. the glory\
that came with not needing to wake up to\
go to school.. but the sadness of not\
being able to see your friends for some time.

when i take long weekends using vacation days\
as a working adult, i evoke similar vibes from\
those times. gotta go degen mode for sure on\
the long weekends. gaming. eating. binging.

...

damn, what am i doing?

thanks for reading today's post.\
am i a caricature of a human?
