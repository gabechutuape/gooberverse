i feel like everyone's got an opinion\
on daylight savings time as a concept.

most people i know are like, "can we just\
stick to one time? and just not fuck with it?"

i'll admit i've never looked into the actual\
functional purpose of daylight savings time\
and instead assumed it was an antiquated thing\
that probably doesn't have any place maintaining\
its own existence in the year of our lord 2024.

but in a chaotic way, daylight savings time is\
kind of entertaining. its neat to see everyone\
talking about the same thing, even if it's joint suffering.

thanks for reading today's post.\
ah man the sun is gonna set so early now..
