they're one of my favorite snacks of all time.

| *the legendary bag design of chester's hot fries.* |

chester's hot fries, distinct from the Cheetos line of products\
from Frito-Lay, are a bag that was once priced at $2 only for\
a 6 oz bag of chips shaped like fries, with a saltiness, crunch\
and spice that was distinct enough from flamin' hot Cheetos\
to where it commanded its own respect as a separate snack.

i had my first bag some time in high school, after i was\
made aware of their existence while at the mall with a friend.\
i forever thank him for enlightening me to the glory.

they're different from other spicy snacks. i haven't really\
found another hot fry type chip around me, but i hear that\
andy capp's hot fries are apparently also good. i recommend giving them a try.

thanks for reading today's post.\
don't eat too many. you'll blow up like a balloon...
