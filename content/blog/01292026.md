today's post will be a bit crass, so i apologize in advance.

what do you associate with the feeling of needing to take a shit?

for many people, it's simple. it means it's time to go to the bathroom\
and to go do your business so you can go back to doing whatever you were doing.

for the freaks out there, they would have immediately jumped on my question, however.\
yes indeed, for many of us, a trip to the bathroom is an adventure of sorts.

that is, it is not an obstacle preventing us from continuing what we're currently doing,\
but rather an escape from the thing we were currently trapped in.

this especially applies to people who shit on the clock while at work.\
there's nothing better than feeling your digestive system working to bail you out\
of sitting and enduring the monotony of your desk job.

for this reason, that premonition of feeling like you need to go\
is a comforting feeling to me.

thanks for reading today's post.\
the porcelain throne awaits.
