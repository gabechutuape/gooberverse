you ever heard of putting it on something?

like when someone says "on my mama",\
or "on the dead homies", or "on god",\
you ever wonder what they mean?

to "put it on something" means to lay claim\
that what you're saying is true, and if\
you're lying, then curse the reputation of\
whoever is incited in the phrase.

the person who is incited implies the degree\
of severity to which someone attests that\
they are telling the truth. so that is to say,\
"on homie J" is not as deep as "on my dead grandma".

if someone tells you to "put that on something",\
they're trying to heatcheck you for bullshitting.\
so either shut up or put it on something.

thanks for reading today's post.\
