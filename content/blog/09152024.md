if you're in the Chicagoland area,\
i would recommend getting a burger from Au Cheval.

they're a michelin-star restaurant that serves\
specifically diner fare, but make it *gourmet*.

they're best known for their burgers which feature\
a sunny-side up egg, as well as their garlic aioli.

i took a neat picture of a spotlight at our table\
that had a glass of water and some cutlery.

the place doesn't take reservations, so you have to wait\
anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour and a half to get in.

but i kind of like it that way.\
it keeps the place honest to the everyman, i think.

if you end up going, absolutely get it with an egg.\
their bacon is thickly sliced pork belly, but the applewood finish\
is excellent. i would only get it every other time.

thanks for reading today's post.\
the crispy fries are great too!
