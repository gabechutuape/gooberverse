you ever have to pick someone up from the airport?

are you the kind of person who spins the block via recirculation road\
or do you just get parking and eat the $2-$5 cost of using it\
for less than an hour and then leaving?

when i'm picking someone up who i know is quite punctual,\
i'll spin the block and do loops for a while.

but if it's someone like a further away family friend,\
i'll just park and sit in the airport lobby and read a book.

i find it kind of relaxing to be around the airport.\
it's cozy in that weird liminal sense of transience it has.

so anyway, yeah. today i picked up my cousin from the airport.

thanks for reading today's post.\
maybe men were never meant to take to the skies..
