how can you tell when you're tired?

for me, it's when my eyes have trouble blinking.\
for many people, they would say "they can't keep\
their eyes open as easily", but mine is actually\
feeling a slowness in bringing the eyelids together.

i think it has something to do with staring at\
computer screens basically all day. probably burning\
my eyeballs doing that shit or something.

i've also been told hunger is a good sign\
that you're entering a position of choice:\
either sleep to ignore the hunger, or eat to\
relieve the hunger (but in turn, stay awake longer).

we know more about neurotransmitters in terms of\
sleep science to accept that reduced idea as reality,\
but it was neat when i had first learned of it to think,\
when i got a midnight craving, that it was actually my body\
trying to send signals for "sleep".

thanks for reading today's post.\
i'm gonna go do that now. sleep.
