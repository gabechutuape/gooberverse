have you ever listened to slime asmr?

"slime" is a catch-all term for glue mixed with borax and scented/dyed\
for people to play with. it's a sensory toy for children, mostly\
but it finds a solid niche with asmr people for the gamut of noises\
that come with being squishy and stretchy and gooey, and sometimes crunchy.

my personal favorite are the crunchy ones. my go-to video is\
this one by [korean ASMR channel one-co soba noodles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjyFACr11g8).

in fact, i've recently purchased my own set of slimes from various\
online retailers, which are mostly small businesses in north america\
with mixing machines and production capabilities.

i'm excited to see, feel, smell, and hear the results.

thanks for reading today's post.\
the crunch is just so satisfying!
