what do you like about winter?

winter is probably my favorite season,\
despite the bitingly cold weather.\
i think the temps give everyone something\
to talk about without needing to be all\
sweaty while [lamenting our shared circumstances](https://www.gooberverse.net/shared-suffering/).

also, the cold brings everyone together.\
i think everything feels a lot cozier when\
it's excessively cold. you start to appreciate\
hot food and drinks more, warm clothing more,\
and the indoors more.

as someone who regularly enjoys having ramen noodles\
on cold rainy days, this is basically a season entire built\
around having excuses to partake in having hot soups.

couldn't be better! aside from the dangerous driving conditions, of course.

thanks for reading today's post.\
a place of privilege, i speak from indeed..
