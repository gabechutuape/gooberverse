i think since the new year has started i've been getting more
advertisements for glp-1 medications for weight loss.

it must have something to do with new years' resolutions.
either that or i'm being specifically targeted, which is
a very real possibility. either way, i feel like i haven't
seen ozempic, wegovy, and zepbound taking as much prominence
as i have in previous months at all,
despite knowing about ozempic since last year around june.

i'm trying zepbound injections for the steep cost of $449 a month,
since i'm a young guy with disposable income. i have no idea how
this is gonna go and i have to buy a place to store my meds
and syringes and wipes and stuff, but well. i figure
it's worth trying sooner rather than later.

i'm no stranger to weight loss via good old fashioned hard work,
exercising, and dieting. however, i'm also no stranger to the
idea that the deck is stacked against us in this timeline.
the fact that we're being sold the solution in such a format
speaks volumes to that itself, and the fact that i'm buying it up
is a problem on its own. i can quit whenever though, so it's
no big deal. i've spent more on less.

we'll see how it goes.

thanks for reading today's post.
...does it hurt?
