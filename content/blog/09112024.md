political identity is a complicated thing for me.

for a while, it was a scary thing to have a label and put labels on things like\
"how should the world be?" or "how is the world now?" or "what is my government doing?"\
and understanding that taking a stance means you can't have the benefits of all slices of the pie.

like, that you're gonna lose relationships and favor with people for having\
thoughts that things should be a certain way. like your libertarian coworker\
thinking you're weird for saying transgender people should be allowed to exist.

but i think as i get older, it's more important to take a stance on things\
and to not be afraid of leaning politically one way or the other.\
sure, you open yourself up to being vulnerable and being labeled yourself.

but as someone who has tried strictly to avoid labels,\
maybe i don't know what i'm missing out on.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i'll learn more as i get older.
