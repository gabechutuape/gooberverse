you ever try and talk to people\
that you're unfamiliar with?\
fucking sucks, man.

i think i've written about this before.\
but i've been trying to type more in the\
North American Ultimate Raiding discord server\
among the great regulars of that discord.

let's get this out of the way:\
establishing a presence in a public discord\
is about as spiritually useful as microwaving dogshit\
and having it for breakfast.

but i like to think i'm doing an okay job with\
reacting and backing people's riffs up\
when they do something intended to be perceived\
as comedic... but honestly the more i write and\
think about it, the more i think i'm just playing\
dolls in my head with these characters in the discord.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i should talk to real people i know more.
