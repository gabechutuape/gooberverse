have you ever been to a live concert show?

i went today to the Victoria Theater to see\
"Mass of the Fermenting Dregs",\
an indie japanese rock band touring the states.

i was in a party of 3, the other two of which\
are one friend who is obsessed with the band\
and the other who just really likes going to live shows.

we sat in the ADA section (for disabled people)\
because one of my friends uses a rollator to cope with\
activities that require long durations of standing.

i bought some earplugs to mitigate the effects\
of [extended periods of loudness on your ears](https://old.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1eyj64g/concert_volume_hearing_damage_thresholds/).\
it's not something to joke around about!

it was fun. hearing the instruments and vocals live\
and comparing to their digital counterparts\
makes for a really unique experience of the same song\
but somehow, completely different. luckily for us,\
"Dregs" are a great live performer, so the show was a treat.

thanks for reading today's post.\
if tickets are cheap, why not see a concert?
