one of my favorite anime of all time is "Sonny Boy".

sonny boy is about a class of middle schoolers,\
focused on a boy named Nagara.

as they approach the end of their middle school days,\
they are suddenly transported into an alternate dimension\
where the laws of the world are as fickle as they are mysterious.

their objective is to get back home,\
and in the process realize they have newfound superpowers\
which leads to power dynamics developing\
and relationships evolving in unique ways.

it is a beautiful story about the journey beyond adolescence.\
it is understanding of the human condition in a way unspoken.\
it is creative, breathtaking, sincere, and worth your time.

many key scenes are accompanied by an OST\
that complements it in a way i have scarcely heard before.

one of my favorite songs from it is called ["Spare", by mitsume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvNVdo8Tchw).

"Sonny Boy" is super underrated too,\
for those of you who like deep cuts.

if you are feeling lost where you are,\
or if the path ahead seems uncertain,\
i wholeheartedly recommend watching "Sonny Boy".

thanks for reading today's post.\
coming of age.. just gets me man..
