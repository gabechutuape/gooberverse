the title of today's blogpost is from a song from\
the dr. stone anime soundtrack, stylized in all caps as\
BY THESE HANDS, THE LIGHT OF SCIENCE.

in the beginning of dr. stone, one of the big goals of the\
main characters is to invent a way of generating light\
without the need for fires. thus, they invent lightbulbs\
and on the way make use of electricity. ergo, the title.

i never went back to dr. stone to watch the rest of it\
after my sophomore year of college. that was when my roommate\
decided to drop out of university after his first semester 2nd year,\
and i was stuck footing the bill for a 2-man apartment.

that first semester was truly magical. it felt like everything\
was coming up my way, and i was really finding a place for myself.\
i'm not gonna act like i always think about the what-if's,\
or like covid drastically changed the trajectory of everything after.

instead, i look fondly back on that time as one of earnest hard work.\
i had made it into computer engineering. i had a roommate who was awesome.\
i was making a name for myself in the smash club. and i had friends who cared about me.

what a time to be alive!

thanks for reading today's post.\
electricity is just crazy, isn't it?
