back in the day, minecraft parkour was a thing.

minecraft parkour is an activity that describes\
jumping around on blocks of varying distances\
and heights while trying to avoid falling off.

when i was a kid, minecraft youtubers would\
upload videos of themselves doing parkour maps\
(among other custom minecraft adventure maps.)

they were fun to watch. i would spend hours watching\
seananners, captainsparklez, bajancanadian,\
and The Creatures. yeah, being 10 ruled.

thanks for reading today's post.\
what were you watching on youtube when you were younger?
