something that i consider a personal failing is that\
i can't remember what months have 30 days, and which ones\
have 31 days. (nevermind february and when it has 28 or 29 days).

which is to say, i never bothered memorizing this information.\
it was never critical to learn. whether or not i knew which months\
were longer never helped me in a profound way.

so it makes sense i didn't learn it.

and more than anything, i've found it can be freeing to release yourself\
from the onslaught of information we feel "expected" to know in this lifetime\
as things that are simply not ever going to be helpful to you in any way\
so you may as well not waste any brainpower memorizing them.

just fucken' ignore that shit.

thanks for reading today's post.\
it's not worth your time.
