are you a candy enjoyer? or, more generally,\
how are you with partaking of sweets?

i'm a guy who enjoys candy. you can ask some\
of my friends, i've dropped a line in the past\
that went something like, "dude, for literally like $3.99,\
you can literally purchase around 30-60 minutes of happiness."\
in reference to the idea of purchasing a bag of skittles.

skittles rule. fruit flavored candies are good.\
this is not to alienate chocolate/biscuit based candies either.\
they both have their own place. a balance works best.

my thing is though, when you have too many candies,\
i get kinda stir crazy. i feel like i'm bugging out,\
you know? it's really a... sugar rush.

thanks for reading today's post.\
all things in moderation...
