this post originally contained a letter i wrote to a friend that i treated poorly\
who i wanted to make up with. the letter was meant to be an apology for my actions\
and a statement on how i'm working on changing for the better.\
out of cringe, i'm redacting it and leaving this message in its place.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i needed to do a bit of reflection it seems
