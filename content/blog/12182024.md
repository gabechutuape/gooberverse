do you live near an urban area\
that has cool stuff for you to do\
but is a decent drive away?

i'm 40-ish minutes out from Chicago,\
which is a pretty big hub for basically\
anything you could think of in terms of\
entertainment or food or what have you.

in my case, sometimes i go with my friends\
to restaurants to sample higher-end cuisine\
than the stuff we can find in the suburbs\
(or sometimes just better marketed cuisine).

something i've been feeling recently is\
spite, however, at going out to functions\
and having them feel kind of... "pointless"?

like spiritually i think all hang-outs\
are worth it. on the level of connecting\
with other people and having that chance\
there can be no greater gift.

but i guess this is the product of having\
certain priorities on your mind. for me,\
my main priority is progging FFXIV ultimates.\
so i guess i shouldn't be surprised that\
literally anything else isn't exactly appealing.

hm.

thanks for reading today's post.\
one day, this too will fade..
