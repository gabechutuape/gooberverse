anyone else listen to stuff that only they listen to, and none of your friends can relate?

there's a few things i've found that basically only i know myself to listen to:
- ambient sound videos (walking in tokyo, library study asmr, [sounds of a mcdonald's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJY5jgO6HAc))
- animal crossing music for fun (i downloaded local versions to listen to on spotify)
- the same thing that isn't necessarily a full song for an obscenely long time
  - once when grinding uni work, i listened to Dark Fantasy by Kanye West but just the first part where they literally go ["can we get much higher so high oh oh oh"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axKNURRvqXA) for 30 minutes straight
- work/study jazz streams on youtube that kind of don't even feel like real music

my coworkers and i were going to lunch one day and i was the driver,\
and i got clowned on because i had "8 P.M." from Animal Crossing: City Folk playing.\
but come on. [have you heard that song?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOzJBldXOAA) the vibes are so good.

| *i, like many people, was super into AC:NH during the pandemic. but i liked animal crossing music so much that i had 4 different playlists on spotify with them.* |

i feel like i have a higher patience for listening to stuff that's slower and monotonous\
compared to the people i know when i ask what they listen to.

or at least, every time i've asked "you ever listen to [school exam hall ambience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnahH-iQLjQ)?"\
i've been met with a sometimes confused, sometimes intrigued, "..no..?"

if we're getting really weird, i even go back to [old nightcore mixes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEo392foDAg)\
of songs released in like 2000-2010. they scratch a nostalgia itch in my brain.

i stand by ["better off alone" by alice deejay (nightcore ver.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5U69uUVgUU) having done more\
for my mental health than the UIUC counseling center services i had to schedule to go to.

most people would agree all of it is pretty cringe to be honest, but well..\
i decided it's easier to not fight it. not like i'm bothering anyone, right?

thank you for reading today's post.\
..come on, don't look at me like that.
