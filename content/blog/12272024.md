something you may never have noticed\
about youtube mixes like "relaxing cafe lofi"\
or "animal crossing relaxing music"\
is that half the time they come with\
annoying fuckass crunchy rain ambience.

i think some channels can do it.\
but definitely not all of them.\
and it just sucks to see what would\
otherwise be a great mix that accomplishes\
its job get ruined by the constant..\
too loud sound of "rain".

i enjoy rain ambience when appropriate!\
but balance the damn levels, man!

thanks for reading today's post.\
first world problems.. ;_;
