i heard from one of my older coworkers that\
eventually, as you age, you require less sleep.

makes sense, metabolic function and all decreases\
as you grow up since you're not.. growing anymore.

i just never put two and two together that the\
aches and pains that seem to persist because your\
body isn't recycling itself as quickly as it used to\
was equivalent or in tandem with not getting more sleep.

when i think of someone super tired i think of\
having bloodshot eyes. either that or like, bedhead.\
or maybe a raspy voice from being dehydrated.

anyway, i'm liking sleep right now.\
it's a vibe.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i think i'll get some sleep myself!
