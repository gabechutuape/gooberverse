today i saw LOOK BACK, from the creator of CHAINSAW MAN in theaters.

LOOK BACK is an animated film about two girls who aspire to be mangaka,\
or manga artists. it is a movie adaptation of a one-shot from Tatsuki Fujimoto,\
the creator of popular manga CHAINSAW MAN, starring Denji (the chainsaw man).

one-shots in manga are a mangaka's way of creative expression\
either between projects or without the restriction of ongoing ones.\
it's like releasing an entire storyline but inside of a 50 or so page\
single unit, instead of several chapters that would be multiple pages each.\
it's kind of like an american novella, but for manga.

the film was phenomenal. the emotion brought to the screen was\
the perfect representation of what makes a good film adaptation\
and wastes no effort in asserting its own existence while effectively\
conveying the themes and gravitas of the original work.\

although it is no longer showing in theaters in the united states,\
i would recommend you watch it wherever available.

thanks for reading today's post.\
the movies are fun to go to, aren't they?
