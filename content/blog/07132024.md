never underestimate the power of some fresh air.

in general, taking a breather is a super good strategy\
for tackling problems in the most effective way.

i'm sure this isn't the first time you've heard this advice.\
but this certainly does not need to be the last time you hear it, either.

but specifically breathing air from a different place\
than the one you're currently in hits so massively differently.

often times, after we are in conflict with someone,\
we come to regret the way we acted.

"why did i say that?" or "what was i thinking?"

and in these times, a momentary pause to consider the factors:\
location, decorum, audience, time, relationship, etc.,\
can give you the perspective and distance you need to reach\
an answer that you won't regret in the future.

in other situations, you may find yourself stumped\
with a problem that feels mentally insurmountable.

take a moment to take a breath of fresh air,\
and reground yourself in the context of the world you live in.

rumination on problems like these\
is a good way to get nowhere fast.

consider taking a breath of fresh air the next time\
you encounter either of these situations.

thank you for reading today's post.\
the air in here is quite stuffy, i must say..
