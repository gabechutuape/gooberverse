i've had an amazon prime subscription since 2018,\
and i use amazon to buy so many things.

basically anything i don't care to go buy in-person,\
potentially spending some of my afternoon going out to buy things,\
i would rather buy on amazon with prime.

it's super convenient.\
but i know it comes at a cost to the universe.

sometimes that thought wins,\
the thought of the environment suffering indirectly\
as a result of supporting amazon and their activities.

and unfortunately, i think i'm complacent\
more often than not.

i just bought some facial cleanser that i could easily\
just buy from my local supermarket,\
but why do that when i could get it delivered\
AND get cash back on it? it's a no-brainer.

so yeah, i'm in pretty deep.

how about you?

thanks for reading today's post.\
come on, no way it's my fault.. right..?
