when's the last time you chewed gum?

back in high school and under days,\
chewing gum was the absolute item to have.\
you could trade it for anything.

either that, or you would take a piece out\
and then the person next to you would be like\
"hey man, could i have one? :^)" and then\
it's like, well, i'm gaining social credit\
by giving you this piece of gum but also\
if i don't know you that well it's meh.

i still chew gum to this day: i always keep\
some sticks of Extra sitting around. in middle\
school, i used to do 5 Gum, and i've also had\
the icebreakers cubes, but those are a little\
different with flavoring at whatnot. for me,\
it's gotta be some kind of mint. which Extra does.

gum helps me focus, i've noticed. i don't know if\
it's something about providing my oral fixation\
with a thing to hold onto or if the mint chemicals\
release something into my brain, but it's nice.

have some gum this week.

thanks for reading today's post.\
unless you don't like gum. then don't.
