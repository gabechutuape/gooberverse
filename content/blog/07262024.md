i'll probably do more of these sets.\
i'm having a great time shooting with the X-T30ii.\
using the film simulation recipes is a really satisfying way to get a style\
without needing to edit in post. although i do enjoy using lightroom!

thanks for *looking at* today's post.\
let's go outside! the weather is great.
