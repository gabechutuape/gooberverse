do you wear hoodies? or are they\
too schlubby/casual for you?

i'm a big hoodie enjoyer. i love my hoodies.\
i have a hell of a collection. a shitload of them,\
a lot of which i don't even wear regularly.\
but if there's something i'm surely addicted to,\
it's buying hoodies that i think i'm gonna wear.

i recently picked up two Akimbo Club hoodies,\
a pullover and a full-zip, and an Hours Collection\
graphic full-zip. The Akimbo club zip-up is a little small,\
but the hood size is good. and the pullover is excellent,\
but the color is a little garish (it was a bold choice that\
i thought i could challenge myself to wear.)

the Hours hoodie is great! i've purchased from them\
in the past before and was relatively satisfied,\
i just gained weight and they didn't fit as great.\
but after coming back after a couple of years,\
they're just as great as i remember, if not better!

hoodies are great to me because of the comfort that comes\
from just wrapping yourself up in a hood, blocking off\
everything else around you. i also love the silhouettes\
that are created around the upper body from baggy hoodies.\
it just looks very nice. relaxed. chill. cool.

thanks for reading today's post.\
and who wouldn't wanna be chill and cool?
