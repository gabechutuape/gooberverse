how old do you think is "old"?

for humans, i feel like you aren't really "old"\
until you're like, in your 50s. and even then,\
i might only call someone in their 60s truly "old".

healthspan is a concept that Peter Attia talks about\
in his book [Outlive](https://www.amazon.com/Outlive-Longevity-Peter-Attia-MD/dp/0593236599) which he defines as\
the range of age in which we are healthy enough\
to live our life to the extent of our wishes.

that is not to be confused with lifespan,\
which is the range of age in which we are not dead.

your healthspan usually ends a decade or so before\
your lifespan ends. you can imagine a bedridden elderly person\
who essentially cannot function with assistance from\
another human to perform basic needs.

i've been thinking recently the question of\
"how old do i intend to be?"\
as in, what age do i project will i pass away,\
given no extenuating circumstances of sudden injury\
or cancer, or some other such disease?

hopefully 80. 80 is a good number.\
i think something could claim my life before then,\
so i'll at least intend to live until 70.

thanks for reading today's post.\
50 years from now.. what will life be like?
