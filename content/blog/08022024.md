what kind of music do you listen to?

right now i'm bumping a city pop playlist.\
city pop is a term for Japanese pop music from the 80s\
that usually takes a soft-rock/boogie vibe with nice funk vocals.

otherwise i have some songs in a loose playlist that are just\
fun to sing in the car or are catchy to me in this moment.

i can't tell if i'm good or bad at making playlists for the ages,\
playlists that you actually go back to and listen to even from when\
your taste in music has evolved from who you were back then.

some of playlists are like that, but definitely not all of them.

but in these moments, when i'm writing these posts,\
i tend to listen to something lower-pitched and repetitive to get in the mood.\
right now i'm doing the song from the "english or spanish" meme, "static" by steve lacy.\
god damn that shit is funny.

thanks for reading today's post.\
oh.. i actually use spotify.. sometimes YouTube too!
