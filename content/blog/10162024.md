an unfortunate consequence of protagonist syndrome\
is that people will view other people as NPCs.\
alternate term for npcs is skinwalkers.

people who you communicate with as a human\
and it doesn't feel like you're talking to them\
or that they're consuming any information\
that you're relaying to them in that moment.

i've been playing a bunch of FFXIV ultimate raids\
and partying with random people to do the game's\
most difficult mechanics can lead to a lot of\
finger-pointing and blame game-ing other people.

but it can also be an opportunity for synergy,\
for growth, communication, helping each other,\
and triumphing over our differences to solve a common goal.

the latter is unfortunately the exception and not the rule.

i've been told that the greatest lie\
that individualism ever sold was that\
we should "try to be the change that\
we want to see in the world", when in reality\
it is the concerted effort of groups\
that bring about significant change.

i'd like to be altruistic about situations like this,\
but man is it hard. there are some shitters out there.\
i'm definitely sometimes a shitter out there.\
but we're all human. so i guess it makes sense.

thanks for reading today's post.\
game politics.. yep. this is my life.
