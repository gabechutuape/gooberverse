i'm on the 2nd to last chapter of [Blood, Sweat, and Pixels](https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Sweat-Pixels-Triumphant-Turbulent/dp/0062651234) by Jason Schreier, videogame journalist. i got to this point a week or so ago, and i was thinking "man, maybe i should just sit down and finish this book. there's only two chapters left!"

but this year i've been thinking more about [the reading process, and reading to have read](https://kaushiksamba.bearblog.dev/reading-2023-and-2024/) rather than trying to really sit with a book. so, i've been taking it easy with *Blood, Sweat, and Pixels* in favor of that attitude.

i was having a conversation with my cousin a few weeks ago about books i read recently and there were a couple of them whose titles i even forgot entirely. to my credit there were a handful of lessons i retained from them, but to not even remember the title? it doesn't do great justice to the book being a useful source of anything, really.

so i'm trying to stew with the books. that means, at the very least, being intentional about when i read and when i don't, and [being proud of whatever decision i make](https://www.gooberverse.net/in-spite-of-logic/).

no use forcing it, right?

thanks for reading today's post.\
no, i'm not procrastinating. stop it. shut up.
