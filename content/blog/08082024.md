sometimes, you just gotta take it on the chin.

a lesson i've had to learn many times in life is that\
things aren't always going to go as planned.\
and when they don't, it's important to persevere.

on the same side of that coin,\
it is important to interpret your losses not strictly as negative,\
but as learning experiences and as things you can learn from.

your losses become way more productive once you can do this.

for my part, i was raiding in FFXIV with my group tonight,\
and we didn't end up clearing the fight we wanted\
even though we got pretty close.

some of the losses were because of me,\
and others were because everyone failed together.

and while it would be easy to blame myself for the losses,\
it's much more mentally productive to look back on the session\
thinking about what i had learned throughout it.

anyway, the best we can really do\
is just strive to do better next time.

thanks for reading today's post.\
that is, if there is a next time. if there isn't.. oh well.
