have you ever heard of ["night terrors"?](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-terrors/symptoms-causes/syc-20353524)

they're a phenomenon that almost sounds like a nightmare,\
but the distinction is that you stay asleep despite going through the nightmare.\
the important part is that the person undergoing them doesn't wake up.

i don't have nightmares or night terrors really, but i just wanted to focus\
on the words for the most part. i think they sound neat. "nightmare". and "night terror".\
what hauntingly strange words.\
they're sometimes called "sleep terrors" instead of "night terrors".

i was thinking about night terrors because i've been reading higurashi: when they cry.\
one of the characters has... something similar to what can be described as night terrors.\
which is another thing entirely separate from "sleep paralysis".

thanks for reading today's post.\
glad i don't have any of those...
