fandom wikis are so bad.

they are a fucking blight on the world of wikis.\
instead of information, you get unskippable ad\
banners that follow you as you scroll,\
outdated information that's poorly moderated,\
shit-ass color schemes that burn your eyes,\
and a content section that only takes up 50%\
of the actual width of your screen.

can you imagine making a service that's meant\
to have optimal delivery of information\
and it's flanked by the most shit-annoying\
advertisements while ALSO having nothing of substance?

yeah. that's fandom wiki.\
i'm being facetious, but i'm...\
really not a *fan*.

thanks for reading today's post.\
if you ever have to make a wiki, please do not use fandom.
