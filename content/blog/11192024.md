are you the kind of person who likes\
to rip the bandaid off when it comes to\
the bad news? or do you cope a little bit?

coping is a mechanism where you act like\
things are better than they are because\
to acknowledge that they aren't would do\
greater mental damage to you than you can\
sustain at that given moment.

usually, when you cope, the longer you've\
been coping, the worse it is when you rip\
the bandaid off. so i try to not cope.

when someone tries coping for me or pitying\
me for when i fuck something up, it kind of\
feels good because i feel a little less like\
i'm being blamed for a thing, but also it\
feels like bullshit because if i'm told that\
something is "easy" and i get it wrong,\
i don't feel good for them telling me it's okay.\
i feel bad because it's easy and i still got it wrong.

i'm not saying one strategy is better than the other.\
but i'm definitely a bandaid ripper.

anyway.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i AM gonna let it get to me..
