after months of using the realforce r2 as my daily driver board,\
i am back to using the qk65 v2 from qwertykeys.

i built this keyboard out using [Sunny Side Up linear switches](https://cannonkeys.com/products/sunny-side-up-linear-switch) from CannonKeys.\
these switches were chosen because i thought they were a\
rather neat looking gag of a switch design; i was pleasantly surprised\
at how nice they sound after lubing and filming.\
honestly, probably my favorite linear of all time\
(and i've tried ink black v2, tangerines, etc).

i'm switching back to the qk65 because i have been playing\
an insane amount of FFXIV recently and the technical inputs\
required for me to do what i'm doing as well as the mashing\
i'm doing while gaming is taking a toll on the endurance of\
my left hand. realizing that my switches on the realforce r2\
are naturally heavy, which is great for typing but not for gaming,\
i tried switching back to a lighter linear switch rather than\
the rounded tactility and heaviness of a Topre switch.

it has worked to great effect! i no longer feel fatigued even after\
particularly strenuous sessions, for which i am grateful that\
i decided to build this keyboard at some point in the past.\

[also, it just sounds great.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5h_mqy-rGE)

thanks for reading today's post.\
FFXIV players be like "this gameplay is fire" and it's just them pressing a single button for 15 minutes
