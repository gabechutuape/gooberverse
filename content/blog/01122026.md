have you listened to lil tecca's 2025 summer album, [dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_(Lil_Tecca_album))?
it's a fun one to listen to, starting with the single release of "Dark Thoughts",\
which is now up to 24M views at the time of writing.

i had heard Dark Thoughts in the past,\
but i had never put two and two together in terms of\
thinking Lil Tecca could make more songs similar to that\
given that it was the single and probably going to be\
the best song on the album.

while some songs are kinda whatever,\
i'm happy to report that OWA OWA and Favorite Lie\
(and also The Truth, since it segues into Favorite Lie)\
are pretty good too.

lil tecca's songs are quite groovy to listen to,\
which i think is an apt description if you know\
what any of the songs i listed sound like.

if you haven't tried, give him a listen.

thanks for reading today's post.\
seriously, dark thoughts is just so catchy...
