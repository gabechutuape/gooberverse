i've been watching my friend play limbus company recently.

something about a new chapter, called a "canto", dropping and that means\
more content to enjoy at a rapid pace rather than the maintenance quantity\
of gaming that usually comes with mobile games when there isn't something\
new to do.

it had me thinking: i'm not sure if there's anyone on this world i could\
like enough and be interested in enough to pick up a mobile game.

i liked umamusume for a while when it came out,\
but i ultimately dropped it after it ended up feeling\
like too much of a rat race. i guess in a way, i let it consume me.\
so really, it's a me problem.

i love sharing experiences that people are fond of with those people\
because i think it's a quick and easy way to get to know someone.\
but mobile games? man... it's a tough sell.

thanks for reading today's post.\
although, to her credit, limbus seems pretty cool.
