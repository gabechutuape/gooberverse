how is the quality of your skin\
during the wintertime?

i need a very particularly plentiful amount\
of lotion pretty much everywhere to maintain\
the healthiness of my skin when it gets cold\
and dry outside. especially my hands.

whenever the dryness of my hands gets to me,\
i lament the natural flow of things that are\
beneficial to you to only feel necessary when\
you have fallen victim to a trap already.

then, when you're sitting pretty, you get relaxed,\
and you drop routines that were good for you,\
since they don't feel necessary.

what a fucked world. why can't it be easier, man.

thanks for reading today's post.\
sorry for all the doomering recently. it's just real.
