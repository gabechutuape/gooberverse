you got games on your phone?

i know a few people who are actually really into mobile gaming.\
and i mean gacha games, mainly HoYoVerse. they seem to be pretty popular.

i tried genshin out a few times and the music is actually quite relaxing.\
but i could never get into the "playing it daily" part of it.\
it seemed like a huge chore and not enjoyable for me.

i thought this was a reflection at one point in time\
on my ability to maintain committed to a thing\
and my resolve to finish, or continue what i'm doing.

but then i realized that there are just some games that i don't like,\
and there's no use in trying to convince myself\
of something that just isn't gonna happen.

far easier to let yourself be attracted to the things\
that are.. naturally attracting to you\
and not the things that just seem to be popular with others.

yeah, definitely a lot easier.

thanks for reading today's post.\
puzzles and dragons? dokkan battle? eugh..
