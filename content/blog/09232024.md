i've been playing a lot more [Disco Elysium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Elysium) lately.

in the game, you play as a detective who is guided by his internal aspects,\
like "pain threshold", "reaction speed", "visual calculus", and "inland empire",\
on your journey to solve the case of a hanged man and your retrograde amnesia.

it's having me think a lot about how my self-talk works.\
"volition" in this game is your ability to resist temptation,\
and to be a "good guy" and to do the right thing.

meanwhile, something like "inland empire" is your sense\
to feel the supernatural and divinity in things happening\
or within things that are otherwise not related at all.

i would like to say something more profound about\
how it makes me consider how the different voices in my head\
inform the decisions i make in the real world, but..

unfortunately, all i can say with confidence is that\
..i just like imitating the narrator voices\
that all the different aspects have.\
it makes introspection a lot more fun.

thanks for reading today's post.\
you should play Disco Elysium.
