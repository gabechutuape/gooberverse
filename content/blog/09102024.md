i've long been a fan of the [razer deathadder](https://www.razer.com/pc/gaming-mice/deathadder-line) line of gaming mice.

my first razer mouse was a [razer naga hex](https://www.amazon.com/RAZER-NAGA-HEX-Adjustable-Ergonomic/dp/B01DT48W5S), which was very useful when i was playing Dota 2 as it was made to accommodate the 6 slot inventory of potential active items in the game. after that, i had a [deathadder elite original](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Elite-Mechanical-Ergonomic/dp/B01LXC1QL0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31NOQNDRGH9AD&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IbJRrcRmRCm9zYtqib_8PSaiIfzdoP8AYRtqt2AlniuTgKCdUEozKc6tEB9Z2zLocqQJdE-P94YEmV1vategq063IV18qBMVangf2FIEOefI9jjz5LTBNVTACaK5IX21Mc2PVQPyCPeQ3mTEWKPabQ.FyhDBs3Wr8jMbIFckgdvnr9rmSxTrz_qHkyFQxt7Ga4&dib_tag=se&keywords=deathadder+elite+v1&qid=1726018713&s=electronics&sprefix=deathadder+elite+%2Celectronics%2C85&sr=1-1), but gave it up because i wanted more side buttons. the shape was something i would never forget, however.

i tried for a brief moment after that to use the [razer naga chroma](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Naga-Chroma-Programmable-Adjustible/dp/B01798WKTY), which features 12 buttons on the side. this didn't last particularly long before i started finding issues with double click ghosting on the mouse, so i dropped it.

seeking greener pastures and having had a long-standing crush on steelseries peripherals, i went over to the [steelseries rival 650](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-650-wireless), because i was convinced i would like heavier mice, and i wanted something wireless (the listing now is for $65, can you believe i bought it for around double the price msrp at the time?) it was a mostly awful mouse. the clicks were satisfying, but the weight was so heavy that it was just cumbersome, which i thought would make each movement of my arm feel intentional but instead it just made everything... heavy and inconvenient (to nobody's surprise).

so, i went back to razer and tried the [razer mamba](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Mamba-Wireless-Programmable-Gaming/dp/B07GBYYSMF). it was a cheaper option compared to the deathadder elite v2, but it didn't last nearly as long as i would have liked (under a year). so i bit the bullet and spent more money on the illustrious [deathadder elite v2 pro wireless](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B08FQMBKQG). this mouse was a dream, coupled with its wireless charging capabilities, i had bought two of these mice over the course of four years until finally, a few days ago, i upgraded to the razer deathadder elite v3.

deathadders are commonly plagued by double click issues which never really went away until razer introduced optical switches for their mice instead of mechanical ones. but now that they have optical switches, the problems are mostly gone. and the shape is still something i'm super in love with. and the mouse is lighter than ever!

thanks for reading today's post.\
gaming peripherals are key to performance, you see.
