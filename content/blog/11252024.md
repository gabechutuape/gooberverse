i've been recently thinking about how\
pausing before you speak can really be\
powerful beyond what you might think it accomplishes.

i mean, i'm 24. sure, it sounds kind of\
ridiculous to be making this discovery at my age\
as opposed to like, 12 years old. but i'd say\
the best lessons are ones you learn for yourself.\
nothing beats a primary source, after all.

so in listening to one of my new higher-ups,\
i noticed in his speech cadence that he takes the time\
to always make sure he's saying what he means to say\
and relies as little as possible on assumption to carry\
the meaning of what he wants to convey.

it's admirable. i find it effective and that\
the fact that he takes such consideration is\
a testament to his desire to communicate well.

i'd like to try implementing it myself.

thanks for reading today's post.\
... sorry, let me just think for a second.
