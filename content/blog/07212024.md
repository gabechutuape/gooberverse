do you remember those stupid videos\
where people would be like "how to unlock shadow in smash bros"\
and it would say you had to do multi-man smash on hard\
for like 20 minutes without losing a single stock or some dumb shit\
and people fell for it?

i just randomly remembered [those videos](https://youtu.be/IjV6mQEyMQ8?si=n1wWexN3w1MT8ksF) today.\
the internet was such a different time. i miss it.\
it's only natural to miss it. it was a simpler time, for all parties involved.

it makes you think about how rapidly memes get recycled nowadays..\
it's a double-edged sword.

i've probably been more exposed to more genuinely useful content on the internet\
than i would have ten years ago if everything had stayed the same.\
but at the same time i miss how much gravity ragecomics had, man.

thank you for reading today's post.\
stickpage.com.. newgrounds.. those were the days..
