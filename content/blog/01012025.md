what do you think about when you think of the new year?

my mind goes to the winter season in animal crossing games.

| *animal crossing is, as you know, one of my favorites.* |

christmas, of course, is represented by the complete darkness of the living room\
save for the beacon of light that is the christmas tree\
left on overnight to keep the magic of the holiday alive.

but new years... doesn't have an ornamental figure.\
so i like to think of the calmness that comes with\
being on winter break, and as a kid, that meant being\
on my wii or my DS playing animal crossing.

many people will immediately think of new years resolutions.\
they can do that. i do it partially. but who cares?\
i think my thing is cooler.

city folk... i miss city folk...
