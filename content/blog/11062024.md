truth be told, i've never really\
exercised my political muscles at all.

i think for a large percentage of young people,\
it's easier to just kind of not think about\
this type of stuff when people are always like\
"server rules are no politics."

but if you go looking in the right places,\
you find the discussion channels for it,\
and that's where the real grimy shit happens.

like the joe rogan experience! America's premiere\
political content delivery source by podcast listeners\
around the nation, receiving joe's drip-feed libertarian\
takes and guests at the tip of their fingers.

i've been listening to the Donald trump episode recently.\
honestly they both speak well. but as someone on the left,\
it feels like listening to skinwalkers speak in a way?

anyway. i'm super ignorant about all this stuff so\
bear with me when i make blanket judgment statements.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i'm more of a Yard podcast listener.
