i've been having a bunch of chipotle recently.

whenever i eat it, i think about how chipotle is now newly referred to as "slop bowls".\
and to be honest, i like my slop bowl. meat and rice is a staple meal for filipino americans.

however, what i've concluded is that something in [my order of chipotle](https://www.gooberverse.net/ordering-food/)\
is absolutely wrecking my shits afterwards. which, you know, gross, but it's my blog.

the thing that perplexes me even more is nothing in my order is spicy.\
i don't order tomatillo red anymore, that shit just burns both on the way in\
and on the way out. and yet, here i exist shitting every 30 or so minutes\
and just having it burn. man, the steak is so good but this just sucks.

i should just learn how to make imitation chipotle steak at home.

thanks for reading today's post.\
the things we do for love...
