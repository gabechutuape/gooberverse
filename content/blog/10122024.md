on the tip of your tongue..

we've all been there, where you have\
an earworm in your brain but you can't\
place the name of the song.

today, i had that with [this track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XP2XDR7hr0) from\
final fantasy xiv, which has very "the end"\
vibes to it. but it sounds a lot like something\
that could easily be in ff7, or even an anime.

luckily my friend recognized it when i hummed it\
so i was spared the mental anguish from\
not knowing it.

so basically, bother everyone you know\
when you can't remember the name of a song.\
someone is bound to know it.

thanks for reading today's post.\
so satisfying..
