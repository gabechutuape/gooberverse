you ever have japanese curry? in any form.\
katsu curry, curry udon, curry soba,\
they all share one thing: the rich base.

the beauty of japanese curry is the fundamental\
heartiness that it brings to your core upon\
consumption. as is the case with all cultural\
stocks, the flavor of japanese curry brings a slightly\
tangy, salty, and filling mouthfeel that heats\
your mouth down through your digestive system.

might not be the most beautiful way to word it,\
but that's how i see japanese curry. the most\
classical dish being japanese curry katsu, served\
with a bed of white rice, is an amazing traditional\
japanese meal. my current favorite is Tokyo Shokudo's\
char-siu curry-base mazesoba: a mix of soba noodles,\
dry ingredients, a poached egg, and plenty of curry stock.

i love having these flavored dishes on cold days\
like the ones we're seeing in Illinois right now.\
it's just a shame the place i wanna get them from\
is over 30 minutes away..

thanks for reading today's post.\
definitely try some if you haven't already!
