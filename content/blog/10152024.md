"grimy" feels like it sounds.

when someone does something underhanded,\
with clearly identifiable ulterior motive,\
(but we're not talking anything criminal here),\
that dude is being grimy.

slimy is a similar word that somehow\
also sounds similar to grimy.\
lying about something or making\
a bad faith argument? absolutely\
grimy behavior.

lying about how far you've made it in a\
FFXIV raid? grimy behavior. but sometimes\
you gotta do it because everyone else is\
doing it. prisoner's dilemma, you see.

thanks for reading today's post.\
just some grimeballs out there..
