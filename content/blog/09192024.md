today i'm starting a series on the gooberverse\
featuring songs that i think fit well in a night-time setting.

when i say night-time setting, i envision the glow of an LED monitor\
on tired eyes, illuminating an otherwise wholly enveloped dark room,\
the owner of such eyes acknowledging that while everyone sleeps, he alone is awake.
or perhaps the constant frequency of overhead freeway lights\
washing over a sedan as it makes its hour-long journey home at 11:58PM,\
pondering the events of the evening and further still what comes next morning.

in those moments, i might think of [*modulogeek*'s song, "around"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMHTj5SV-pc),\
from his EP "walking around aimlessly", for which there are three tracks:\
"walking", "around", and "aimlessly".

this song was used in hotline miami 2,\
a beloved indie game featuring brutal top-down combat\
charming pixelated graphics, and absolute fucking jam of a soundtrack.

give it a listen.

thanks for reading today's post.\
