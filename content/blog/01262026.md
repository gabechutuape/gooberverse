my dad is a big fan of orange juice.

he always buys the no-pulp kind.\
tropicana, costco, simply, you name it.\
we've had them all in this house.

it's one of those things that i associate with him\
beyond all the other things he's given me in this life.\
between his brash impatience and his gentle compassion,\
there are few constants.

but orange juice has always been in our fridge\
even after any kind of health scare my dad has had.\
(i guess because the problems were never about his sugar.)

when he's gone,\
i know a wave of memories will wash over me\
if i ever get another glass.

thanks for reading today's post.\
yes, i do like the no-pulp kind.
