i think the reason it's called couchsurfing is because\
you're going from place to place, i.e., different couches,\
and crashing on them in sequence day to day.

i believe that going to different couches is what makes it\
specifically count as couchsurfing.

however, for the purposes of my life experience having never done that,\
i count the periods of time where i sleep on my couch instead of my bed\
or any couch for that matter, as "couchsurfing."

this month of january i spent the entire 31 days sleeping on my couch\
which is conveniently located in the same room as my PC.

it's been a long journey, and i miss the feeling of mattresses.\
the couch cushions are great in a sort of primal way,\
but the creation of mattresses was something i wouldn't miss for anything.

thanks for reading today's post.\
sweet dreams!
