balloon by tyler the creator from his new album,\
"chromakopia" is definitely a dinky song.

dinky songs are ones that sound like they're being played\
with tiny instruments or by dudes in goofy looking costumes.\
they can generally be applied for comedic and diminutive effect.

a famous dinky song is [that one dinky ass song from kirby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfewZjo79Hk).\
i like to use dinky songs to calm myself down in tense situations,\
or to refocus myself and ground myself for a moment where i need to perform.

which sounds a little silly. listening to something\
so dinky. but it helps! the quieter music helps.

thanks for reading today's post.\
give it a try! dinky music is great.
