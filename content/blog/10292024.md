how are you with small talk at the office?

some people are excellent at it. usually these\
are people who are either up to current events,\
interested in some sort of easily common activity\
like sports or movies, or are just generally\
good at showing interest in other peoples' lives.

i feel like i'm not terrible at small talk,\
but you ever get into a conversation with a guy at work\
and it's like you can feel the parts just..\
not fitting together right? like they might almost\
be there, but they're DEFINITELY not getting there.

i have yet to figure out how to worm my way\
out of that one. i usually get by with stuff like\
water refills or bathroom breaks. but sometimes it's\
just like there's an air about the vibe where there's\
almost an expectation on *myself* to keep it going?

maybe i'm fighting ghosts. it could be possible.\
in fact, after writing this out, i'd be inclined\
to believe that the pressure is probably entirely\
self-inflicted and in reality the guy is just\
giving an honest attempt at conversation.

well. i'll live.

thanks for reading today's post.\
coworker talk.. can't live with it, can't live without it..
