there comes a all-too-familiar time in a man's life\
or a woman's life, for that matter,\
where they act as though it's time to truly give up\
on everyone and everything.

it doesn't have to be significant, major, or astounding\
in any sense of the magnitude of things that would\
otherwise "justify" upending your entire worldview\
of how you should interact with the things around you.

instead, it comes at a very specific time:\
once the clock strikes beyond 2AM.

never trust your own thoughts after 2AM.\
for overthinkers like me, when nobody is paying attention at 2AM,\
i start to think that nobody cares about me.

but we all know that's a lie.

thanks for reading today's post.\
at 2AM, the voices get extra loud.
