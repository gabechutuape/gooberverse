sometimes, talking to someone else is all it takes.

people just take comfort in knowing that what they're saying\
is being heard by someone. and it can be comforting in and of itself\
to speak truly from the heart to one another.

there is no substitute for this. in fact, in any case where\
one may believe themselves to have found a substitute for\
genuine human interaction, they will certainly find themselves\
paying for it in spades later down the line.

confrontation. with the self. with others.\
is this all we're here for?\
a convenient dichotomy to draw.\
yes, we're on this planet for one thing: the thing itself,\
and everything that isn't the thing.

hmph.

thanks for reading today's post.\
a tiresome mental wheel...
