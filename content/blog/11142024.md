it's tough being a fan of the "Persona" series.

Persona fans are stereotyped into ignorant people\
who, having consumed only Persona content, see stuff\
that they think is from their games in other media,\
and then they're like whoa it's just like persona\
but in reality persona stole those things from them, etc.

it's a useless exercise in what's "derivative content"\
among also having persona fans be people who are just\
generally cringe and lame? or at least the outspoken ones\
tend to be on X, the everything app and other social media.

anyway, ["Everyday Sunshine"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_3mbCzJPJI) is a track from Persona 4 Golden\
that's just a fun, bright listen that i'd recommend you\
lend an ear to when you're having a good time,\
like i am after my static made good progress in raid today.

thanks for reading today's post.\
persona 4 golden was definitely a great game..
