we're all familiar with how hard it is to start.

it's always the first step, it only gets easier,\
etc, etc. platitudes and cliches, all about the\
difficulty of doing something new in starting\
from zero and just, really, truly *doing it*.

i am reminded of this on this day, and so\
i wanted to share it with you, the gooberverse.\
that we may all find freedom in trying something new.\
it's a classic lesson for a reason, i believe.

thanks for reading today's post.\
don't read too much into it, it's just about gaming. (it always is)
