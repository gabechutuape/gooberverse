have you ever heard of [any austin](https://www.youtube.com/@any_austin)?

he's a youtube video essayist who makes commenataries on video games about
things that are outstandingly mundane, like power lines in GTA 5, hydrology, and unemployment surveys.

i'm fascinated by his content. his cadence and pacing, especially, is
uniquely captivating in its presentation. i've since exhausted his catalog of
skyrim related videos, and found other skyrim video essayists EXTREMELY wanting.

something about them is just too nerdy to follow. any austin finds a great niche of
making things that are boring seem quite interesting, and somehow, other essayists
take things that should be interesting and make them somehow quite boring.

a shame that i'm out of skyrim videos from him. but he has more.

thanks for reading today's post.
i especially like his unemployment surveys.
