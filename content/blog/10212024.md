have you heard ksi's new song?

people are clowning on it on the internet daily.\
feedback like, "it sounds corny", "KSI sucks",\
"the song is trash", etc etc.

well let me be the first to tell you:\
it's true. the song is corny. it sounds like\
it came out in 2018 for the summer season.

which is not to say it sounds literally terrible\
it just.. sounds quite generic. and also\
he's just dickriding himself so nobody\
really likes that or finds that relatable.

also, a lot of people just dislike KSI\
because he collaborates with Logan Paul,\
who is almost decidedly a piece of shit,\
so by association he must also be one.

it's just a song. people ascribe meaning to the\
quality of it and how shit it is but let this\
be a lesson to everyone: the internet is loud\
and meaningless. none of this shit means anything.\
KSI is gonna make money off of this song,\
and whether its shit or not doesn't really change anything.

sorry to go full doomer. it's just like.\
pointless. i mean i like pointless stuff\
as much as the next guy but when it's complaining,\
it's just annoying.

thanks for reading today's post.\
