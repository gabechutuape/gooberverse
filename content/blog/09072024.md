how long have you ever spent doing a single thing?

i don't mean breathing. i mean something that requires active\
consciousness and participation that you can't do without trying.\
something like writing a manuscript, or reading a book,\
or doing something outside, or even doing work.

today, i spent 10 hours playing deadlock.

so.. yeah. but it was a hell of a saturday.\
i had a great time.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i promise i'll go actually [touch grass](https://www.gooberverse.net/touching-grass/) tomorrow.
