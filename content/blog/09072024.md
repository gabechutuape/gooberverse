how long have you ever spent doing a single thing?

i don't mean breathing. i mean something that requires active\
consciousness and participation that you can't do without trying.\
something like writing a manuscript, or reading a book,\
or doing something outside, or even doing work.

today, i spent 10 hours playing deadlock.
