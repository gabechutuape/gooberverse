for the beginning part of 2025,\
i was unable to upload new posts to the gooberverse.

i couldn't understand why this was the case,\
other than seeing my github build and deploy would\
invariably fail on new document submissions.

it turns out that with the help of AI,\
they were able to detect a particularly sneaky\
and irksome backslash that had somehow appeared\
in the header bit of the .md files i was trying to upload.

i was unable to see it because previously,\
these entries would be written using Notepad,\
which is incapable of spotting these otherwise\
invisible backslashes. VSCode has sufficient visibility\
into the problem to expose it. and so now,\
i'm writing them in vscode.

the more you know.

thanks for reading today's post.\
to think, it stopped me dead in my tracks...
