have you ever heard of sans rival?\
it's a filipino buttercream and cashew layer cake.

| *an image of a sans rival cake that i found on google.* |

my dad, when he was growing up and assisting his mom (my grandma)\
with the local pharmacy business, took up a year in culinary school\
learning how to be a baker.

this instilled a love of both baking and cooking for the rest of his life\
in him. while my mom is good at preparing traditional filipino dishes\
like adobo, sinigang, tinola, sinampalukan, and nilaga,\
my dad is undoubtedly the king of the oven.

one of the things he's decided to recently hone in on ever since\
the christmas season came and went was sans rival cake.\
it seems sans rival is seasonally consumed around the holidays.

a fresh sans rival cake is the perfect mixture of crispy interior layers\
mixed with smooth buttercream. one that's been refrigerated for a week\
is a bit less impressive, but still yummy nonetheless.

as a victim of a sweet tooth, i had a slice recently and thought to myself,\
"one, it sure would be nice to be able to bake. two, this feels a bit heavy."

thanks for reading today's post.\
do you have a cultural homestay dessert of your own?
