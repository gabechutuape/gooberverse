how do you feel about CCP?

and i ain't talking about the Chinese Communist Party,\
i'm talking about *Chocolate Chip Pancakes*.

i somewhat got into chocolate chip pancakes after\
watching *The Good Doctor* because of all the Dr. Han memes\
that were on Twitter, the show in which the protagonist,\
Dr. Shaun Murphy's favorite food is chocolate chip pancakes.

having never had them before learning this fact about him,\
i tried them out and they're fairly decadent, but definitely\
a nice treat to have every once in a while.

these days though, it seems more people are into waffles.

thanks for reading today's post.\
you ever had.. a square pancake? they exist!
