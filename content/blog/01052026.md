the thing about good habits, and life in general really,
is it feels like all you're ever doing is keeping up.

it's a battle of attrition against the natural flow of life,
that we all undertake knowing we're going to lose someday.

despite that, it's all we can do, to call this life a "life",
to continue making what we can of each day.

it's often quite demotivating to remember that things
are tasks that you have to keep up. it helps a lot to
reimagine things, instead, as things that give you "joy",
rather than things that are, well, chores.

given enough introspection, you could probably turn
anything that you love into just "another thing to keep up",
like this blog of mine which i neglected for a year.

but it goes without saying that on the other end of the stick,
given enough introspection you could probably convince yourself
that anything is worth your devotion.

thanks for reading today's post.
choose to see the brighter side, again, and again...
