i don't know about you guys,\
but i'm not the best at staying hydrated.

sometimes i'll get a dull headache and think,\
"man this sucks. why is this happening?"

then i remember it's been, oh, i don't know,\
**four hours** since i last drank water.

water needs no introduction. it's the goat liquid.

they talk about getting a minimum amount of water per day,\
but i'm pretty bad at tracking how much water i've drank.

i usually just do it to kill time or while there's a pause\
in a conversation with someone i'm having difficulty talking to.

actually, i know people who have aversion to the taste of water\
(who, surprisingly, don't have rabies), and it blows my mind\
that that's even possible for a human to be that way.

a refreshing cold sip of water after you're parched..\
does anything beat that?

i've discussed satisfying things before,\
and it might be second only to the legendary\
end-of-the-day dump.

and it's a *close* second.

thanks for reading today's post.\
remember to stay hydrated!
