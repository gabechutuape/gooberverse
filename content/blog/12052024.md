do you deal with dry skin in the winter?

dry skin, dry breath, dry everything really..

it's the pits. for me, the coldness and shivering\
that comes along with winter is something i accept\
as a necessary step for the coziness that is warmth\
from the interior of buildings and cars.

however, skin dryness just sucks. and i'm a victim.\
it's lotion all the time, face, back, arms, you name it.\
problem being there's no coziness with the dryness.\
it's like going from net neutral to net negative\
instead of fighting for what could be a positive.

well, i guess it's good to moisturize anyway.

thanks for reading today's post.\
stay hydrated..
