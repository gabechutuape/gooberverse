ever heard of water bugs?\
i think that's what they're called anyway.\
they look kind of like smaller cockroaches.

we've been dealing with them recently in the kitchen,\
and my dad is one of those guys who thinks he can solve anything,\
so he's been trying strategies to defeat the water bugs.

this includes stuff like placing traps in corners,\
and spraying stuff down,\
and moving food so the bugs can't get to it.

we suspected they were coming from somewhere around the sink,\
since they're "water bugs", they're attracted to moist places.

but my friend's dad, who used to work in pest control,\
asked us for a picture of the bug to give guidance on how to deal with them.

turns out we skipped the one spot that was very moist\
that hasn't been cleaned in a while,\
right under our noses,\
*the dishwasher.*

so i guess we'll get to cleaning.

thanks for reading today's post.\
pesky bugs..
