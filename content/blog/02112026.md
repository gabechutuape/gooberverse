i've been listening to the [pokemon colosseum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRr9aarnCc8) ost recently while doing ff raids.

i miss that game and gale of darkness. they were the two more\
"adult"-oriented pokemon games, exclusively released on GameCube.\
on top of having awesome soundtracks, the 2v2 format and aesthetic\
earned themselves a spot in many a 2000s gamer's mind as\
"peak pokemon" in terms of having a unique look to them.

my specific thing is that i don't remember beating either game.\
when i tried playing gale of darkness, our memory card was corrupted,\
and for some reason i didn't think i could ask my dad to buy a new one,\
so i would only be able to play as far as i could get without saving\
which wasn't any significant amount into the game at all before\
the console got shut off and the TV turned off while i went away to\
school for the day.

good memories. give the soundtracks a listen! miror b's theme is espcially iconic.

thanks for reading today's post.\
