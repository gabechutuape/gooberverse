happy birthday!

on the off chance the day you're reading this is your birthday,\
i will be cosmically popping off over my (and your) luck.

today, august 7th, is my birthday.\
birthdays are fun, of course. in the ideal world.\
you get to spend time with people you love having good food.

but i think birthdays are, due to their emotional amplitude,\
also a time with the capacity for great sadness.

think of ["stale cupcakes" by K.K. Slider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLuKPAH2fJ4).\
this is a song from animal crossing about coming home as a kid on your birthday,\
but your guardian, or parent, or parents, can't be home with you,\
leaving you with just a stale cupcake to blow a wish out to.

when i think of how blessed i am to be among\
family and friends in moments like these,\
every day feels so much more worth it.

thanks for reading today's post.\
the food was great! we had duck, ribs, steak tacos..
