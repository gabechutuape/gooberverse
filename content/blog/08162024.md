odd obsessions are one of the easiest ways to get to know someone.

i've talked about [talking to people](https://www.gooberverse.net/talking-to-people/) before,\
where my point was that we should be understanding that\
the basis of many relationships can be around mundane things.

but when you and another person are both into a niche thing?\
that's when the magic happens, i think.

it depends on how weird it is, of course.\
having an NBA buddy and having a stamp collection buddy;\
two very different kinds of buddies.

but in general, finding those out-of-place commonalities\
can lead to genuine gold, like life-long friendships.

at times when i think about getting into a new hobby,\
one of the benefits i ponder is actually getting to\
talk to people about it. it's pretty inspiring.

thanks for reading today's post.\
so, you do anything fun recently?
