i think it's annoying how tiredness strikes\
the most in moments when it's probably\
inappropriate for you to be sleeping there.

like at work,\
or during lecture,\
or while you're waiting for something,\
and it can never be when you can just..\
sleep a little.

maybe this is just a me thing.\
it's largely solved by just sleeping enough at night\
and not doing things that are boring or uninteresting.

hm.

thanks for reading today's post.\
god damn i could use a nap.
