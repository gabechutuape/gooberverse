the answer is yes.

ponder anything too much and you will get it twisted.

that much is inevitable.

in fact, there is no "correct" amount of pondering\
specifically because there is nobody to tell you,\
"oh, yeah you thought about this the perfect amount of time."

it's only ever "you thought about it too much" or\
"you didn't consider this enough."

which means there's not really much use in getting all\
concerned about it anyways.

but it can be hard.

that much i know.

thanks for reading today's post.\
it's not much use, is it...
