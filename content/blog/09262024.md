you ever go to noodles and company?

went there today for lunch,\
found out they have garlic bread\
five pieces, as an [appetizer](https://www.gooberverse.net/restaurant-appetizers/).

the roasted garlic tortellini was my entree,\
and i enjoyed the meal with my buddy jared.

i haven't been to a noodles and co. since\
back in university, where my usual order was\
their bbq pork mac and cheese, which\
was absolutely excellent. it has since\
been replaced by a bbq chicken mac,\
which i guess could be good. but it ain't the pork.

anyway. would i go again?\
yeah i'll probably end up going again.\
as an asian person, pasta dishes are hard to come by.

thanks for reading today's post.\
the penne rosa is also a good one.
