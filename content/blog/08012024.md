you ever seen ["Fast Times at Ridgemont High"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Times_at_Ridgemont_High)?

it's a classic coming-of-age movie that came out in 1982,\
and follows the story of a bunch of kids in a year in high school,\
going through life as high schoolers do.

there's [Jeff Spicoli, and his stoner shenanigans versus Mr. Hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMtdrKIdDgE), Brad Hamilton and his work woes, Mark Ratner and his dreams of getting a girlfriend, and the "cool" Mike Damone who grifts tickets for random people. they're all entertaining in their own way, and high school/coming-of-age movies are some of my favorites to watch.

it's a fun movie. pretty simple, i watched it on a random website on the internet.\
i first heard about the movie after getting a pair of Vans and looking into the history of the shoe brand,\
and seeing that this movie is actually one of the first widespread appearances of Vans in cinema.\
apparently it did a lot for the brand.

this week is going by pretty quick in my book,\
so i thought of "fast times" to describe that situation.

thanks for reading today's post.\
fast times.. and they keep getting faster, eh?
