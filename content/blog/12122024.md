anyone have any good answers for\
how to reconcile the beastly nature\
of mankind versus the altruistic sense\
that we've developed as humans?

i'm talking about the stuff where it feels\
like the right thing to do is the exact\
opposite of the thing that feels *good* to do.

what's up with that. why can't they be the same.\
it's fucked up that it's not that way.\
whoever designed *it* should have not made it that way.

i guess nothing worth doing was ever easy, as they say.\
but like, dude! fuck that noise. that sucks shit.

i don't have any answers, man. you think if i had answers\
to questions like that, i'd be writing a blogpost like this?

thanks for reading today's post.\
like how veggies are good for you but taste bad..
