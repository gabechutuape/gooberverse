i like to hold my blogposts to a certain standard of length.

for the most part, that is. sometimes they can be particularly long,\
depending on how much i have to say about the thing, of course.

however, i find snippets about the lengths that you might read\
as an adult swim intermission are the best length for conveying a message.

just long enough to say something,\
but just short enough to not be tired of it.

the sweet spot.

thanks for reading today's post.\
did it work? does it feel like it worked?
