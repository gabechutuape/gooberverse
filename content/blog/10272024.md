when at first you don't succeed,\
you gotta have a backup plan.

for me, backup plans are annoying.\
after all, wouldn't it just be nicer\
if things just worked first try?

today i intended on going to a brunch spot\
but i made the grave mistake of going at peak hours\
and decided a 30 minute wait wasn't worth my time.

the backup plan in this case?\
getting food at a place that had similar\
diner-style food. the unfortunate truth?\
that place was closed on sundays.

so the final backup plan was going to Buona Beef\
for an italian beef combo. the old reliable.\
never lets you down, but good luck getting a bite\
of both the beef and sausage simultaneously.

it was delicious. and although i had to resort to\
the backup plans, i wasn't as nonplussed at the\
initial plan falling through because the backup plans were ready.

thanks for reading today's post.\
..why do i always make everything about food..?
