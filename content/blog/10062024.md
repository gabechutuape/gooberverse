you ever had a long wait for your food at a sit-down?

depending on the time you go, it makes sense.\
lunch rush, or at a breakfast place maybe brunch rush,\
the workers are gonna be busy and you won't get it out\
in like, 10 minutes. but ideally before 25 minutes, right?

i developed a new pang of self-consciousness while waiting\
for my server to come take my order at a restaurant today:\
am i an asshole for openly disparaging the quality of service\
to the person i'm eating with at a restaurant?

it's probably a bit of an asshole move? my intention isn't\
NECESSARILY to be within earshot of the accused.\
that's just crass. but i will say that i feel like\
being silent about it is like taking the burden upon\
yourself and resigning it to the natural state of things.

i know a guy who gets a surprising amount of good service\
at most sit-down restaurants he goes to through one simple thing:\
communication.

he just asks the waiter or waitress for an accommodation,\
and then the ball is in their court to provide him with the thing.\
a Gen Z'er like me? i'm sitting down and shutting the fuck up\
but brooding about it afterwards on my blog, apparently.

maybe i should take notes.

thanks for reading today's post.\
the food was good, though.
