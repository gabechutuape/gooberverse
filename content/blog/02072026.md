remember when everyone was chewing gum in school?

i'm unsure if it was a 2000s thing, and i'm sure it preceded\
my generation, but i feel like chewing gum has kinda fallen off.

when i was in school, if you pulled out a pack of 5 Gum or Extra\
everyone was asking for a piece. and handing them out meant\
you were the homie to everyone else. indeed, this is one of\
the first instances of pay-to-win social opportunities.

maybe it's just because i'm older now, but i tend to not find\
people going out of their way to have chewing gum on them.

for my money though, i'm still a chewing gum enjoyer.\
i find a stick of mint Extra helps me focus a lot when\
i need to lock in on doing something like work or raiding.

right now i'm chewing a plastic stirring straw because i\
like reserving the power of chewing gum for me in moments\
when i truly need it. this is more idle chewing.

thanks for reading today's post.\
an oral fixation, perhaps.
