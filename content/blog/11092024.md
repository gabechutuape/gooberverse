have you ever heard of the term "chewing the fat"?

apparently it means to gossip or make small talk\
or otherwise have informal conversation with someone.

my assumption was that chewing the fat would mean like,\
we're ironing out the kinks or something? or we're going\
through the shittiest, swampiest part of the thing we're doing?

but no, it actually means having small talk. and surprisingly\
the origin, on Wikipedia, is contentious: nobody actually knows\
what "fat" anyone is really "chewing" or why.

i kinda like the turns of phrase that nobody can place\
an origin on. it maintains the mystique and allure of\
fomo when it comes to being there and knowing what's trendy.

anyways.

thanks for reading today's post.\
my blogs chew the fat a bit, perhaps...
