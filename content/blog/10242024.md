ask any person who spends time on their computer:\
the worst thing ever is internet issues.

people don't like feeling like they're\
not in control, unsurprisingly, and so\
when it comes to catastrophic problems\
that are basically strictly out of your\
hands, internet problems take the cake.

restart the router? are there a shitload of people\
using the wifi at your house? are you gonna have to\
talk to a support line to get this shit fixed?

i got AT&T fiber internet with great speeds,\
but the connection is intermittent every like week or so.\
which fuckin blows. if it was not already apparent.

my conclusion? i would take greater stability\
over higher peaks in download speed. it just feels\
better that way.

thanks for reading today's post.\
robot voices in discord are funny though.
