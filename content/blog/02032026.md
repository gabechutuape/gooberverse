my sleep apnea has been acting up recently.

i attribute this to the weight i've gained over the winter.\
it's quite annoying, and i didn't realize how much of it was\
simply due to having more mass around your neck, so to speak.

i think sleep apnea mostly affects overweight people\
rather than people who have something fucked up about their airway.\
i mean i'm sure not everyone with sleep apnea is overweight,\
but i think it's a majority/minority kind of thing.

anyway, it's a great motivation to get in shape.

thanks for reading today's post.\
