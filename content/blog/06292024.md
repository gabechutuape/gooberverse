i was thinking today about what it's like being an npc.\
in the figurative sense of being an npc with reference to other people,\
and literally being an npc in like a video game or a movie or something.

like in a scene where the main character overhears something important\
while they're at a bar because two dudes are having a conversation that's\
just a little too loud, i'm imagining those guys getting interviewing like it's\
a documentary and they're like:

"yeah, what's up. i'm mike. i'm a bar gossiper."\
"it's a pretty chill gig, i just talk really loudly every day at the bar about stuff that's going on so that if a main character shows up he knows where to go next."

i mean if you're an npc, you don't really have explicit thoughts i guess?\
so it's probably fine for them..?\
like, if they don't voice it.. is it fine?

and as an npc myself in the perspective of other people,\
i think i'm doing fine. so maybe being an npc isn't so bad.

i guess what i'm trying to say is, if i had to be the guy who's job it is to gossip loudly in the bar so that the main character knows where to go next, i'd be okay with that as a job. like i'd know i'm doing something valuable and it seems fine.

thanks for reading today's post.\
NPCs are people too, you know.
