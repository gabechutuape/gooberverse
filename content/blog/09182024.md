i heard something a long time ago.

something like an internet adage, or maybe from a TV show.\
i'm not sure of the origin anymore, but it stuck around.\
in forms different than it originally appeared.

"never trust your thoughts after 11pm."

thoughts about.. what?\
about yourself, or about your job,\
or about people, or about things in general, i think.

it isn't always 11pm either. it could be after midnight. or 2am.\
the times changed as life changed, i think.

in practicality,\
i believe it was a saying to stop yourself\
from making rash decisions when your mind was tired.

as i write this entry at 11:45PM,\
i'm reminded of it.

thanks for reading today's post.\
definitely *do not* spend over $100 on random bullshit after 11pm.
