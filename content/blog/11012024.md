i was thinking about this the other day,\
you ever consider the education system\
from the perspective of the teacher and\
not as the student (as many of us were at one point)?

when i was a kid in elementary and middle school,\
i always thought teachers had it in for me\
or that they were singling me out for being\
relatively innocuous.

turns out i was being an active obstruction\
to their ability to just clock in to work and do\
the job that they're trying to get paid for.

it's a sobering thing to realize. especially as\
a working adult now, it would suck so bad to have\
an absolute terror of a piece of shit-ass kid who thinks\
they're being cool or funny stopping you from teaching.

anyway.

thanks for reading today's post.\
those were definitely some times back then..
