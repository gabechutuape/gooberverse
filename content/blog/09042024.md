you wanna go to culver's?

[Culver's](https://www.culvers.com/) is a midwestern classic.\
it features their signature "butterburgers",\
which are burgers with their buns buttered,\
as well as cheese curds on the side.

if that wasn't enough for you, they also make\
pretty good desserts in the realm of milkshakes and concrete mixers.\
there's a lot of decadent options available.

for a while, i had a slight apprehension to culver's,\
since it's so greasy and whatnot.\
i try not to go to culver's too often\
because the place honestly makes me feel like\
human filth after i finish eating it.\
but it is pretty damn delicious.

burgers have been on my mind recently though,\
so i went to culver's and got a mushroom and swiss\
with some cheese curds. it was.. excellent.

if you have a culver's in your area, i'd recommend going\
when you wanna have something of a cheat meal.

thanks for reading today's post.\
mushroom and swiss is my favorite, actually.
