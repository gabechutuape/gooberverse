how easy is it for you to say it was "worth it" when you buy something?

do you spend your money on things that have dubious practicality,\
or otherwise applicability in your life?

i'm going through a pretty heavy mirrorless camera research phase..\
if this sounds interesting, please [look forward to the results](https://www.flickr.com/photos/201072478@N07/)!

but to the point, i rented a Fujifilm X-T30II for the duration of 7 days,\
and almost convinced myself to buy the X-T50 before the X-T30II had even arrived!

the X-T30II is surely a camera that's worth my time if i'm interested in its successor,\
so it would be rude to not give it a fair chance anyways.

what a waste of my rental money it would have been if i had gone through with it, huh?\
.. or would it have been a waste?

i'm not sure i'm convinced many things are wastes at all.\
i think a lot of things feed into decisions that seem apropos of nothing,\
least certainly of all the exact thing you suspect will have no bearing on it.

in my case, if i had pulled the trigger,\
the rental money i spent despite probably not ending up using it\
for the full "worth it" duration of 7 days,\
would mentally be allocated to the conviction of soul i made in making the other decision.

i might be overthinking it.\
it could be easier to call it a waste.\
but it's a little more fun to think of it in this way, i think.

thank you for reading today's post.\
..a rewards deal that expires today? well, better not let it go to waste!
