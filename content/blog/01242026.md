it's so tiresome being an overthinker.

i claim anxiety. i do not shy away from its presence in my life.\
and yet who am i to say whether it's made me "better" for having\
experienced and dealt with it.

all that i know is that it runs my brain ragged thinking about\
people and relationships and how to do things and what the\
"right" thing is to do in any given situation.

it's not like everyone else who doesn't have anxiety doesn't think\
about things like that. but i know for damn sure i have it worse off.\
the cross we are given at birth to bear can just be awful tiring at times.

and at the end of every road, the same conclusion:\
nothing to it but to do it.

thanks for reading today's post.\
sigh... i guess you're right...
