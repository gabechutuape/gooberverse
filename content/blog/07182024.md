have you ever been to a korean bbq place before?

i love going with my friends to [Mr. Kimchi](https://www.kimchibbq.com/) in Mt. Prospect.\
we don't go particularly often, but when we do, i always enjoy myself.

korean bbq is where you sit down at a table that has a grill in the center,\
and you order various meats to cook yourself at the grill,\
in addition to various side dishes that (ideally) complement your food.

it's an awesome experience to do with friends because grilling the food gives a common objective for the party, while the duration of time of the food to be grilled gives constant air for conversation to move naturally.

you'll find yourself drifting from real life stuff to the taste of the food and what you're going to order next to whether or not the meat on the grill is ready yet in a nice, routine flow that makes any gathering feel more alive.

for my part, i love Mr. Kimchi for the corn cheese (literally just corn cooked into melted cheese on a skillet) and the spicy pork. 
they are fan favorites among our group, and the other people i've managed to bring to the place. it also only costs like, $35 for all-you-can-eat per person, and you will definitely be full by the end of it, believe me. when you satiate the cravings you get for this place, it hits like no other.

i was originally recommended the restaurant from a coworker who has since moved on to work at Toyota Japan, so we don't get to see each other anymore. but every time i go with my friends or family to this place, i am thankful for being given the chance to discover how great it could be. i say this especially because i had tried kbbq when i was in high school, and all i got from it was that it was overpriced and a lot of effort. but i was young then, and i didn't give it a proper chance.

if you get the chance, i recommend trying it out with your friends or family.\
who knows, maybe you'll end up with a new regular spot to bring people?

thank you for reading today's post.\
sharing good food with good friends.. nothing beats that.
