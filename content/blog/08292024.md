have you ever been told to "touch grass"?

"touching grass" is a term used on the internet to tell people\
that they need to go outside and re-align themselves with reality,\
because their behavior on the internet is so outlandish and unreasonable\
that it surely implies they haven't spoken to a real human in some time.

"touching grass", therefore, is something you can only do outside.\
and with your real body, not a virtual one.\
so it makes for the perfect action for telling someone to go outside.

touching grass isn't always a bad thing. it can be used in a more general sense\
to describe that you're doing things outside, that aren't playing video games\
or rotting on your living room sofa watching anime or television.

for example, you might hear the following words in a Discord call:\
"Alright guys, I'm getting off for now. Gotta go touch grass."\
and people would likely congratulate that person.

touching grass is a reminder for ourselves to use grounding techniques\
and to not get caught up in the whirlwind of online nonsense\
that seems to be sensational and rage-baiting more than ever nowadays.

..but you can also use it in the aforementioned inflammatory sense.

thanks for reading today's post.\
maybe i should go touch some grass..
