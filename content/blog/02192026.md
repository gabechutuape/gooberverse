people talk about light reading. light novels. but light writing?\
never heard of that in my life.

i'll say from my perspective, it's fair to say that there are fewer writers\
than there are readers. it wouldn't be a normal past-time, depending on\
what circles you run in, to consider actively "writing" a hobby.\
much less "light writing", which is to draw a comparison between itself and\
"heavy writing". which i guess could mean working on a book?

a writing equivalent of an artist's sketch, or a reader's chapter.\
maybe like writing a poem? for me, writing these blogposts count\
as "light writing". not that i have any heavy writing, that is.

thanks for reading today's post.\
if you're writing *about* light, however...
