remember long weekends as a kid?  
those endless Saturdays..  
but they somehow went by too fast.

or semester breaks in general. the glory  
that came with not needing to wake up to  
go to school.. but the sadness of not  
being able to see your friends for some time.

when i take long weekends using vacation days  
as a working adult, i evoke similar vibes from  
those times. gotta go degen mode for sure on  
the long weekends. gaming. eating. binging.

...

damn, what am i doing?

thanks for reading today's post.  
am i a caricature of a human?
