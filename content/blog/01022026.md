i'm pretty bad with my sleep schedule.



i think i've written about this one before

but it bears repeating because it is so pervasive of a problem for me.



how do you reconcile staying up because the rest of the world is up

playing games and having fun

with needing to be up the next day?



at some point, something has to give.

i wonder when that time will come for me.



thanks for reading today's post.

i'm strictly nocturnal.
