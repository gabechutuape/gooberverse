how are you with your spices?

when i was a teenager i would fuck heavy with\
getting super spicy flavored stuff and getting\
things that were spicy just thinking it would be\
"tastier" than mild alternatives, somehow.

could be anything from chip flavors,\
to chicken wings and their sauces,\
to bowls of ramen noodles:\
if i could get spicy, i probably would.

as i've grown, and successfully having destroyed\
my stomach and intestinal lining,\
i'm kind of out on ordering "hot" flavors.

here's the thing: you order something spicy\
and then suddenly the rate at which you're eating\
is slowed down, you're sweating, you're huffing and puffing,\
you need napkins to blow your nose with, it's a goddamn mess.

meanwhile the other people in your group\
ordered reasonable, mild flavors and they're\
watching you suffer like an animal at a zoo exhibit.

the social aspect is one part of it, but even in\
isolation, having spicy food for me nowadays is just...\
what the hell am i even trying to prove?\
i just don't even bother.

at the peak of my hubris i ordered Hot Ones'\
famous The Last Dab XXX sauce to put on chicken wings.\
i thought that shit was cool. it was kinda cool.

but i'm okay with saying it's beneath me now.

thanks for reading today's post.\
if you can handle it, more power to ya.
