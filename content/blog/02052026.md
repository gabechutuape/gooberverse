have you ever met someone who, when you bring up their birthday,\
they're like "oh it's fine you don't need to get me anything!"\
and then when you proceed to listen to them and get them nothing,\
they're upset by it?

you can probably think of at least one time this has happened\
and it's pretty annoying. i mean, there's something to be said about\
that line that they gave being a social cue that, yes, they would be\
receptive to a birthday present, but it begs the question:\
why aren't we just more obvious about things?

sure, being humble is a virtue. but also,\
unless we consider the words we use,\
things are going to be taken as they are, i fear.

if you don't care about getting things for your birthday,\
then make sure you mean it.

thanks for reading today's post.\
still not subtweeting.
