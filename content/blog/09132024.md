broccoli cheddar soup is a beautiful thing.

the melted, slightly salty flavor from the cheese,\
the scent of broccoli wafting into your nose,\
and the ear-to-ear warmth that a spoonful gives.

i recently rediscovered broccoli cheddar soup\
at my local Potbelly sandwich shop on lunch break.

the first time i had broccoli cheddar was\
my freshman year of college, six years ago.\
i've never gone out of my way to purchase it,\
it was from the meal plan at my dormitory.

but having had it recently, i have definitely been missing out.\
and maybe you have too! you should seek out some nice broccoli cheddar.

thanks for reading today's post.\
or any soup, for that matter.
