you ever tanked some shit?

tanking something, per its roots in video games,\
refers to enduring something painful and bracing for it\
rather than attempting to avoid the thing or to gracefully\
dodge the thing in some way.

you may be confused with something "tanking",\
which refers to when a thing fails miserably or\
lowers drastically over time, like TV ratings "tanking".

the tanking i'm talking about is the endurance one.\
like, you can tank 2 hours of sleep in the sense that\
instead of getting a good 8 hours of sleep you just\
thugged that shit out and went on about it anyways\
enduring the suffering that comes with insomnia.

tanking some shit is tuff. tuff like cool, but also\
not really respectable? as i get older, it's not quite\
as respectable but it takes guts to tank something like\
getting berated, lack of sleep, physical or emotional damage.

either guts or just stupidity, i guess.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i'm absolutely tanking shit sleep right now.
