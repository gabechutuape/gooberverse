i like ikea quite a bit.

if you've somehow gotten to this page and aren't aware of what ikea is,\
ikea is a Swedish furniture store that sells modular listings for fair prices.\
their quality is the definition of middle-of-the-road, and is usually just good enough.

i think it's a common opinion that using ikea for furniture\
is somewhat of *settling* for shittier furniture that's easier.\
it's like ordering something off amazon instead of from an actual website.

but for me, as someone who's really only decorating his room,\
i don't particularly care to decorate with bespoke items.\
ikea's simple offerings are pretty much exactly what i'm looking for.

i'll expand someday, i'm sure. when i feel that itch to get something i can really\
call my own to decorate my room with,\
like a focus piece instead of the composition of the room.\
but for now, ikea is good enough for me.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i should try the ikea food court some time..
