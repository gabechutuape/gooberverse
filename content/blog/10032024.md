you know the feeling of finding a good song?

this was me recently after i somehow avoided\
the entirety of "brat summer", featuring charli xcx's\
album "brat", which debuted to the warm reception\
of many twitter users and club-goers alike.

perhaps the most popular track, ["360"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI6GP8wKJ6o), ended up\
in my lap after i saw a [isco elysium-style edit](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_heNegS8wo/) it\
featuring the main character performing a 360 spinning back kick.

i've been spamming this song while playing space marine 2\
and it's just.. such a jam. definitely the type of song\
that just makes you wanna stop what you're doing and.. groove.

always a joy to find a new catchy song,\
as late as i am to the party.

thanks for reading today's post.\
rediscovering old songs is great too! just like new..
