have you ever focused *so* hard?

so hard that you have to actively think\
about replenishing your sucrose stores\
inside your brain so that you can\
continue doing what you're focusing?

i'm currently doing a challenging raid\
in FFXIV that requires constant focus\
and i went for 5 hours today of just\
straight mechanics after mechanics..

but it will all be worth it!

thanks for reading today's post.\
yes.. this is where my focus should be..
