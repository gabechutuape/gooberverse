increasingly in today's AI-relevant world,\
we as users of the internet must be diligent to\
the dangers of consuming AI-generated content.

is what they would tell you.

they would tell you that to give in to it, to accept it,\
would be giving up on the glory of the human soul and its\
ability to create, inspire, and share with others.

however, to be quite fucking frank,\
if i enjoy a thing, i'm good enough at separating the art from the artist.

there'll be a million counterarguments.\
and none of them will look good.

but something i've learned is that you have to just\
accept when you have an opinion like that\
and just recognize where it's appropriate and inappropriate to voice it.

it's just easier that way.

thanks for reading today's post.\
