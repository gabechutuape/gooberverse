do you remember taking exams in school?

didn't have to be in university,\
we don't discriminate against education levels\
around these parts.

but for me, the standout ones DID happen\
to be when i was at university, because man\
those exams had hands and i was caught lacking.

but pass or fail, with exams, the best part is:\
when they're done, they're done. once you turn them in,\
it's out of your hands and you can stop worrying.

no feeling of liberation greater than that.\
it was beautiful. go get a bite to eat with\
your friends, and go to that place you really like,\
because fuck it, you just got out of an exam.

miss those days.

thanks for reading today's post.\
school was brainwashing, in a way..
