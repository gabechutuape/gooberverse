when you get a headache, what do you do about it?

growing up, i never used ibuprofen or acetaminophen to cope with headaches.\
i just assumed they would go away eventually. also being a boy mean thugging shit out.\
in my adult years, however, i have opened the pill bottle a good amount of times.

that being said, my initial reaction to a headache is still not to reach for a substance.\
my usual suspects are hydration, hunger, and sleep, in that order.\
so i'll try drinking water, then checking if i've eaten, then wondering how much sleep i got.

if i happen to make it to wondering how much sleep i got,\
then i'll consider popping an ibuprofen to get through the headache\
(assuming that at the time of the headache, i don't want to go to sleep).

but it makes me wonder...\
why does it feel like every time i take a pill to solve my problems,\
it feels like i cheated in some way?\
like flipping to the back of the book\
because i couldn't figure out the answer.

hm.

thanks for reading today's post.\
it's probably not that big of a deal. i hope.
