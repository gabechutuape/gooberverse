there comes a time when you start realizing\
just how many lies you tell yourself.

stuff like assumptions about way things work,\
ways you think people interpret what you do,\
ways you think things should go, and ways\
you do the things you do.

one i'm recently trying to tackle is my perception\
of the difficulty of "doing" things.

people say stuff like, going to the gym is "hard".\
but what if it weren't hard? for the people who go\
all the time, i'm sure it's actually quite easy.

so how do you become one of those people?\
steal their attributes. act like it's easy.\
until you fool yourself, or into realizing\
that it... actually is easy. worst case, you\
consign yourself to not doing it at all, sure.\
but best case, you gain a new skill or hobby.

kind of based, honestly.\
just be real with yourself.\
nobody else will do that for you.

thanks for reading today's post.\
life is maybe just a battle of not lying to ourselves...
