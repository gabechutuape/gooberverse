the cyclical nature of life can be amusing.

which sounds extremely unemployed, but despite everything, i am actually still employed.

the amusing part of it is how right now i'm pretty sure i'm in a downturn, and yet\
i have a good feeling that things will turn around pretty soon..\
not for any reason that should be considered ominous. it's just hope.

when i first began doing things that were new to me,\
what i learned was that small changes every day\
add up to big things later on down the line.\
you need to invest in order to build something worth it.

it's a lesson i'll spend the rest of my life learning.

thanks for reading today's post.\
the goal is just to keep it simple.
