is it an adult thing to do\
to ignore someone you're in proximity with\
rather than working your problems out together?

i'm all for a healthy amount of distancing,\
but i think outright ignoring someone is childish. confront each other\
with intention and purpose and not just for the sake\
of getting it over with,\
but do it for fucks' sake if you're going to do it.

we're too old to be doing shit like\
not drawing clear boundaries and telling each other\
what we want and where things are.\
when things like that aren't clarified,\
it's just too confusing.

i'm not subtweeting at all.

thanks for reading today's post.\
