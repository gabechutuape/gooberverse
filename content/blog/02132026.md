among the mediums available for outputting sound to your ears,\
i'm quite a big fan of headphones. however, as someone with thin hair,\
headphone hair is a thing that holds fear in my mind. the natural compromise,\
while maintaining privacy of course, is ear buds.

unfortunately for me, earbuds come with a natural time limit in terms of comfort.\
i'm not sure if i've just never found the "right" pair or anything, i really only\
buy samsung galaxy earbuds to go with my samsung galaxy phone, so maybe it's worth\
branching out a little bit, but i think my ears are just a little special in terms\
of what i find comfortable. as a fun fact, i have attached earlobes.

my time limit is usually around 1.5-2 hours before i start finding them unbearably\
uncomfortable to wear and would rather take them off than continue listening to whatever\
i'm listening to at the time. the problem arises when i have to have the earbuds on\
for a work meeting or something that's running particularly late.

don't even get me started on speakers. honestly speakers are the ideal but\
between feedback into a microphone and privacy concerns, they're riddled with problems.\
but in a vacuum, a 10/10 speaker setup might beat out a 10/10 headphone.

thanks for reading today's post.\
yeah maybe sony or bose have something good. i should see.
