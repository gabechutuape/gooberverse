i've been getting a bunch of ads for the company burga,\
which manufactures phone cases with artistic designs and collaborations.

one of them recently features some.. famous french dude?\
who has some sticky-note style handwritten quotes\
as the "art" for the phone case.

one of the handwritten quotes is "nothing changes if nothing changes",\
which is something i've always known but never put into words like that.\
i was aware that the cost of a new life is your current life.\
but it's a foundational observation of that idea\
that nothing changes if nothing changes.

it's true.

thanks for reading today's post.\
and boy we could use some change.
