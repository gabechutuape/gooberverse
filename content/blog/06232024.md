how do you feel about being at parties with strangers?\
do you go into it thinking it's an exciting chance to meet new people?\
are you anxious about having to answer questions about who you are?

every time i'm put in that situation, i wonder why i tend more to anxiety\
rather than curiosity.\
was it easier that way at some point in time? ...easier for who?

| *it's quite relatable, actually.* |

is that something i can change?\
surely, right?\
is it something worth changing?\
maybe?

in those same moments with people you're more familiar or friendly with,\
you can really feel the comfort of being with those people.\
when you don't need to put your guard up and really relax.\
those are the best times.

but when you think about it,\
every person you're familiar with now started as the other type of situation:\
"oh.. uh.. so, where do you work?"\
"that's interesting, i didn't know there were people who did that."\
"do you have any siblings?"\
"oh! i actually like that video game a lot too."\
it's the basis of how we get to know one another.\
it is a rare circumstance to have found a friend with whom it feels like that stage\
was so brief and non-intrusive that it felt seamless to call one another friends.

maybe i should try being more open... see where it leads.\
or maybe i have enough friends already...?

thank you for reading today's post.\
so, how's the weather where you are? oh, really?\
it's actually been quite hot here...
