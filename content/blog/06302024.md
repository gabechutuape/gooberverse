what's your ideal end to the day like?

one that's particularly hard for me to beat\
is taking a good dump after a long day of eating good food.\
which might sound crass, but hear me out; it's the ultimate relief.

after travelling and seeing the sights with your friends and walking around,\
talking and eating food at restaurants you've never been to before,\
you end up back in the comfort of your own home, your intestines churning.

and you fulfill one of the many inevitable sacraments of life: defecation.

now that is not to say that all dumps are good.\
i've had my fair share of dumps following spicy food\
that have left me far worse than i was before.

but assuming it's a good dump.. it's hard to imagine something that could beat that.

i could have exercised that day, done my chores, and generally been diligent about things.\
but all of that pales in comparison to the sheer relief that comes with a good dump.

for all of my friends out there with indigestion or IBS, i offer my condolences.

thank you for reading today's post.\
sorry if this one was weird.. but you clicked on it, so i think that reflects more on you. just saying. ┐(￣ヮ￣)┌
