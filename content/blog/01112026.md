i used to listen to a bunch of [The Yard](https://www.youtube.com/@TheYardPodcast)\
in my free time while driving and playing video games.

however, last year at some point, i stopped because i got more in the mood\
for listening to music. i had stopped for long enough that i wondered\
if i would ever be able to return to listening to podcasts.\
it turns out that it just took a little bit of time for it to come back.

there's a calming feeling of listening to the playful banter of The Yard's\
members of Ludwig, Slime, Nick, and Aiden. it makes doing stuff feel less lonely\
and i feel like i get a little funnier every time i listen.

there's over 200 episodes available, so i recommend listening.

thanks for reading today's post.\
and that's not even counting the premium episodes!
