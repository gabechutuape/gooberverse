i've been on a fruit kick lately.\
apples, bananas, even some pears.\
throw a few oranges in there too.

this stuff is honestly the shit.\
sugar, carbs, fiber, all in a nice\
little package that doesn't feel\
like absolute dogshit for your body\
to be consuming? sign me up.

i'm not sure when i fell off the\
fruit bandwagon, but boy was i\
an idiot for letting that happen.

it's literally as the saying goes.\
an apple a day is currently absolutely\
beating the shit out of that doctor.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i recommend fuji apples!
