how anxious are you?

a lot of people are anxious nowadays.\
myself included. i blame my parents.\
it's almost a damn personality trait\
for my generation and beyond.

whether it's getting worried about\
assignments that are due, or work,\
or how you look, or where you are in\
life compared to other people, there's\
a lot of pitfalls of anxiety around us.

there's a hidden power that i couldn't\
unlock until i grew up: and it was the power\
to not give a fuck.

"don't worry about it."\
this statement basically meant nothing to me\
before the age of 18. i just couldn't fathom\
not caring about something or not worrying.

but i'm happy to report that as you age,\
you literally cannot afford to care about\
as much stuff as you think you can.\
not only that, it feels EXTREMELY cathartic\
to confidently declare you actually *don't*\
give a shit about something.\

it feels great, give it a try.

thanks for reading today's post.\
in moderation.
