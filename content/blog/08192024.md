i don't know what public opinion is on awolnation,\
but i'd like to say i actually like their music.

undoubtedly their most famous track is ["Sail"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaAWdljhD5o) which terrorized\
the internet and memes for the better part of a year around 2011.

following their success with "Sail", they received deals from Valve\
to make music packs for some of their games, like CS:GO and Dota 2.

in 2018, they released ["Here Come the Runts"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Come_the_Runts), which featured\
new, more acoustic sounds in a different style from\
their previously electronic-heavy roots.

in Dota 2, you can buy music packs that replace in-game music that plays\
during specific events in each match (leveling up, laning, getting a kill, dying, etc.).\
AWOLNATION released a Dota 2 music pack featuring instrumental versions\
of tracks from "Here Come the Runts", and that's where i rediscovered the group.

i would spend hours playing Dota 2 that summer of 2018,\
and would also listen to the album while at my local XSport.

if i could recommend two songs from that album,\
i'd say ["Handyman"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4YFCdYFXTY) and ["Table for One"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0BOqowbswY) are my favorites.\
["My Molasses"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj5v4N1KN6U) is a close third, though.


i admit, i haven't listened to their newer work since "Here Come the Runts",\
but this album has a special place with me because i definitely don't know anyone else\
who was out here really listening to.. awolnation, of all bands.

thanks for reading today's post.\
do you have a band that it feels like only *you* know about?
