are you the kind of person where when you eat out,\
you always order the same thing from the same place?

i tend to do this a lot.\
for example, my chipotle order is a:
- bowl
  - steak & fajitas
  - white rice
  - no beans
  - queso
  - corn
  - mild salsa


on occasion i'll turn this into a burrito, but for the most part,\
this is what gets the job done for me.

as a different example, if i go to a wing place,\
my go-to flavors are a Louisiana/cajun, and a garlic parm.

i think it's fine to be set in your ways about things like this.

i mean, you know how it's gonna taste, and you're gonna be happy with it,\
so why fix something that isn't broken, y'know?

but on the other hand, we only got to this point by exploring things..

so maybe we should give more credit to trying out new things.

i don't actually know anybody personally who is the opposite way:\
who will go out of their way to try all the different dishes at a place\
because they don't like having the same thing over and over again.

people are creatures of habit, so it makes sense they're (seemingly?) the minority.

this is all to say,\
i'm quite looking forward to eating my burrito bowl from chipotle again today.

thanks for reading today's post.\
have you tried the chicken al pastor from chipotle? not a fan.
