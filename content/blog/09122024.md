you ever phone it in for the day at work?

sometimes for me, that turns into an entire week.

the progress isn't exactly.. critical.. so i never feel\
particularly awful about not doing much when those times strike.

but it definitely doesn't feel great to just kinda do nothing\
so i end up doing the bare minimum of everything to get credit\
and then skating past it into the next week, hoping things will be different then.

it's not exactly the best strategy.\
but maybe you can relate.

thanks for reading today's post.\
friday.. friday..
