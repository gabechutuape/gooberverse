"hyperfocus" is usually synonymous with the\
zone state of mind that one attains when perfect\
conditions are met for single-minded concentration\
on a task, with efficacy towards its completion.

when i think about the word, i think about\
the perk from Dead by Daylight, from Rebecca Chambers.\
it makes it so that when you pass great skill checks,\
you get a bonus speed up to your generator repair rate.

have i recently hyperfocused on anything?\
probably on progging through The Omega Protocol (Ultimate).

thanks for reading today's post.\
sounds so cool. hyperfocus..
