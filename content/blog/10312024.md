for a brief moment, i was fooled\
into thinking that i was above the idea\
of participating in halloween and giving\
candy out to strangers.

like i had seen past the capitalist veil,\
and realized that the occasion was bullshit\
and i shouldn't bother putting anything out.

it turns out, it's at least somewhat\
spiritually fulfilling to donate candy\
to my local population, receiving nothing\
in return besides the idea that i made\
someone's day at least a little better.

so, i guess at the end of the day,\
the lesson is: being cynical kinda blows.\
maybe try not doing that.

thanks for reading today's post.\
twix is my favorite! what's yours?
