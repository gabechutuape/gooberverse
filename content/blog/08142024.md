home-cooked meals are just the best, right?

at this point in my life, i live at home\
and enjoy the benefits of, for most meals,\
being able to eat home-cooked meals from my parents.

for a while i've wanted to get more into\
cooking regularly, but there are some issues i have\
with cooking in this particular home:
- storage issues with existing items
- making food for more than one person
- trying recipes with ingredients that probably won't be used frequently

not to mention the natural struggle of needing to\
clean your own dishes, which i find heavily, if not\
almost entirely subtracts from my ability to feel good\
about the thing i just cooked by the time i get to eat it.

somehow all the effort i put into a dish, instead of making it\
taste better, puts me in the same mentality i get when\
i've worked on a photoshop for so long that no matter what,\
even if it's good by the end, i just unconditionally hate it.

that is to say, you can get easily bogged down\
in how much extra baggage there is to cooking\
besides actually performing the recipe and eating the food.

but it's worth remembering:\
if life is a never-ending loop of dirty dishes and cleaning,\
then life is also a never-ending loop of home-cooked meals and savoring.

thanks for reading today's post.\
today, i ate pork adobo. it was delicious!
