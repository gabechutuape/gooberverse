how often do you fundamentally change\
the bedding that you use to sleep on?

when i say "fundamentally change",\
i don't mean washing your sheets.\
i mean buying new ones or rotating\
old ones back into the mix.

i've been using a bearaby weighted blanket\
for the better part of 2024 now, and it\
was great when it started out. but the ventilation\
offered by the weaving of it is actually proving\
a bit uncomfy in these colder days. so i've gone back\
to my comforter from when i was a teenager.

it's like a hug from an old friend.\
there's something beautiful about the warmth\
it gives me and i'm glad to see it again.

i hope you can find beauty in reuniting with\
something in this way, as well.

thanks for reading today's post.\
blankets are the best..
