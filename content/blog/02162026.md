i wish it didn't feel so hard to talk to you.\
it hasn't even been a year. well, it's almost been a year.\
but isn't it just too sad that it ended up like this?

it's my fault, right? since that day in june,\
nothing was the same. and it was never going to be.\
maybe everything after then has just been me\
living in denial.

you might say it's not that serious.\
you might say we can still make it work.\
you might say you don't want anything to do with me.\
and i couldn't say anything at all.

i wonder if i still cross your mind after all this time.\
i find traces of you in every single place, in every single line.\
maybe i'm afraid of forgetting what we had, too.

did it even matter at all?\
neither of us are strangers to the idea that some people\
come into your life,\
change it,\
and then leave.

so maybe it's better this way.\
you're better off without me anyway

thanks for reading today's post.\
bit of a different one today! the emo is outta control folks
