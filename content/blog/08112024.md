when the chips are down, a cat can change it all.

i've been taking trips to take care of\
my brother's cat recently while he's away.

i have to drive 30 minutes there and back (1hr total),\
so it's a little annoying when i'm on the way there,\
thinking about how i have -1hr minimum in my day.

but then, i see the cat.

and suddenly, all the worries of time that i have\
melt away, straight into her black fur.

i always underestimate how much being with a cat\
can give a relaxing, calming air.

i reckon someday i would like to own a cat of my own.\
to own an animal and to care for an animal of course,\
are two very different things, and you should be prepared for the full job.

someday, though.

thanks for reading today's post.\
isn't she just adorable?
