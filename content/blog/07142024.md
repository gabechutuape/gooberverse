tagalog is a fascinatingly onomatopoeic language.

to be onomatopoeic in this sense means that often\
the words in this language are sonically descriptive\
of what their definitions are.

for example: "kulimlim" is a word that means "cloudy" or "gloomy".\
and "bangga" means "collision", or "crash", as in a car crash.\
or "masaya" means "very happy", and as you say the word "masaya",\
you may notice your mouth naturally opens to a smile..!

although i am not a native speaker of it,\
among the words i do know and hear,\
i am continually impressed by its onomatopoeic nature.

thank you for reading today's post.\
being bilingual is like a superpower to me..
