doesn't it just suck when your\
preconceived notion of things is\
challenged by new facts brought to your attention?

i thought KSI was a reprehensible dude,\
and i still kind of think he is spiritually.\
but part of that judgment being cast was\
the quality of his song "Thick of It".

what's changed? i heard his older song,\
"Lose" with him and Lil Wayne, and it's actually\
pretty good. so now i gotta give him credit.\
and i don't wanna give him credit. but he's got it.

it's kind of this way in general with people\
you just wanna hate on but you learn something\
they do that's like, honestly typical for a good,\
normal human, but you're like "aw."

or maybe it's just me, being a spiteful asshole.

thanks for reading today's post.\
yeah give "Lose" a listen. it's not bad.
