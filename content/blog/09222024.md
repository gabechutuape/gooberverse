they say a lot of stuff about putting on sunscreen.

like how you should put on sunscreen basically every day,\
or how you should put sunscreen on even if there are clouds,\
and how the "repercussions are sooo terrible!!"

this is one of those things where i accept it\
as a fact of life that i'm not in the stage where\
i'm willing to accept that shit as an active\
change to my existing lifestyle.

applying sunscreen every day is debatably hard.\
sure you could just add it to the morning routine,\
it slots in pretty nicely. but like,\
how much skin are you exposing each day?

and then it's like, your hands are basically\
always exposed so you wanna put sunscreen on them,\
right?

now you can't use your fucking hands cause they're\
all sunscreen-y and moist and wet. like what the fuck.\
did anyone think this through? it's bullshit.

i mean, my hands are aging noticeably faster due to\
sun exposure at least visually speaking. so i should shut up.\
but goddamnit, i wish it just kind of.. worked easier.

thanks for reading today's post.\
maybe i just need the *right* sunscreen?
