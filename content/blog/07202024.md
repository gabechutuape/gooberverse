do you like drinking boba milk tea?\
or just milk tea in general?

milk tea is in a weird spot for me as this thing that somehow people view as far more socially acceptable to drink than other similar sweet drinks that are probably outright considered desserts instead of whatever half-category milk teas have carved out for themselves, and it's just interesting to me how far the words "milk" and "tea" go to carry the elusive nature of their nutrition.

i mean, come on. think about bullshit dunkin' donuts iced coffees\
that have more sugar and creamer and syrups than coffee in them.

this is not to say i'm against dunkin' donuts coffee,\
i just think we shouldn't mince words or play games.

milk tea is, in my head, almost as bad as a milkshake to casually drink.

and yet despite this, i am becoming a regular at my local Chi Tea and Boba Nova.

thank you for reading today's post.\
i don't actually like boba.. my preferred topping is lychee jelly..
