if you're a human like me,\
you've definitely had bad days before.

but when "bad days" strike on days when you\
need to perform to a certain level that is expected,\
what can you do to mitigate the effects of the curse?

i like to just pretend it doesn't exist,\
but the thing with superstitions is that they pervade\
the conscious realm and kinda seep around in the\
beneath-layer of your mind... its imperceptibility\
is exactly what makes it take the form of a curse.

powering through it is really all i can do, i've found.\
but most people cope with it by reminding themselves\
that everybody has bad days. which is true. but man,\
does it suck to have it happen to you.

i like to remember a quote from animal crossing\
when thinking about bad days in general.

> "And remember that bad times...
> are just times that are bad."

thanks for reading today's post.\
