i got some gripes with notepad.

specifically, notepad on windows 11.

to start, one thing that's good is that it supports dark mode.\
i don't know if that was there in windows 10.\
if it was, i was not appreciative enough of it to acknowledge it.

i use notepad to write these blogposts (editing .md files),\
and for some god-forsaken reason, closing the notepad window\
does not close the files that have been opened by notepad.

this is not to say that they're still in an open read/write state,\
but that when you reopen notepad the next time,\
all the tabs of notepad that you had open before will still be open.

some might think this is a good thing.\
i think it just adds a bunch of clutter.\
hell, i think it even persists past restarting the computer.

and actually, let's also appreciate that notepad tabs are a thing anyways.\
maybe i should look into a text editing solution i like more.

just my two cents.

thanks for reading today's post.\
notepad is fine, i suppose.
