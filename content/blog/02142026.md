i once had to think about telling my crush i liked her on valentine's day.\
specifically whether or not it was corny to use valentine's day to\
sort of emotionally charge or prime a response due to the holiday.

in the end, i didn't say anything on valentine's because i didn't want\
the feeling of the occasion to overwhelm any sense or inspiration of why\
i liked the person. i wanted, if there were an occasion i had the bravery\
to tell her how i felt, to let those emotions stand on their own.

i've always wondered what it was like on the other side of people who\
participated in valentine's day. couples and whatnot. maybe they find it\
surprisingly tedious to participate in, compared to people like us who\
have got nobody to look at that way on the 14th of february.

thanks for reading today's post.\
...you *are* one of us, right?
