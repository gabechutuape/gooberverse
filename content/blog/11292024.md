i feel like watchlists are a little bs.

"i've been meaning to watch that", or\
"it's on my list but i haven't gotten around to it,"\
are all convenient ways to try and push\
a conversation in the direction of the media without\
having actually consumed it to have a take on it.

i'm not innocent. i've done it before.\
you can feel it socially, that you want the line\
to continue, but you literally can't without having\
consumed the media in question. it can be a movie,\
watching an anime, a TV show, or playing a game.

always sucks to be out of the loop. it's been\
an inspiring thing to me to try new things\
actually entirely for the sake of increasing\
my local storage for what i can have small talk about.

..maybe i should care less about this stuff.

thanks for reading today's post.\
yeah i heard game of thrones was great, haven't seen it though..
