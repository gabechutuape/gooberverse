getting tilted sucks.

tilted is a term that describes when you're doing something\
but you're doing it while annoyed or frustrated\
so you start doing worse\
and then you wonder why you're doing worse\
so you try harder to do better\
which usually is the opposite of what you should be doing\
and then you do even more worse, which makes you more\
frustrated, etc.

getting tilted usually only happens in\
a competitive setting. like video games\
or sports, where you are offered "retries"\
that you can quickly successively fail at.

when i get tilted, i try to remember:\
on the other side of the ego lies success.

thanks for reading today's post.\
nah but being tilted sucks so bad actually.
