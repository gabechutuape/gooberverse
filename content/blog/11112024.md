beatswitches in a track can easily be legendary.

nights by frank ocean? a legendary beatswitch.\
what triggered this thought? i was listening to\
the [dandadan opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCoQMD_qVNo), which features\
an almost ethereal beatswitch every other 1/4th of the song.

another famous beatswitch was Logic's Under Pressure,\
where he switches perspectives from his hustling self\
to the perspective of a little sister writing a plea for help\
to their brother, and a father wishing to reconnect with his son.

what's not to love about a good beatswitch?\
it's the classic subversion of expectations wrapped up\
in what would otherwise be an ephemeral piece of media\
such as a 3-4 minute song that makes it really stick around\
much longer than the listening duration.

honestly, i'm having trouble naming a beatswitch that was terrible.

thanks for reading today's post.\
this opening is definitely going in the playlist...
