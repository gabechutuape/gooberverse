how are you with your sleep schedule?

if you're anything like me,\
completely goddamn terrible.\
without fail i stay up later\
and later playing video games or\
scrolling social media or watching\
youtube and stuff. generally unproductive\
things. and then the times just goes.

on one hand, i feel guilty.\
i should be going to bed so i can\
be rested for the day tomorrow.

but on the other hand this time that i spend\
wasting the hours away, i do enjoy my time.\
it feels like the only real alone time i have.

which is interesting coming from a guy who i feel\
doesn't spend too much time with other people anyways.\
can never get enough, eh?

so i try to remember that time you enjoy spending\
isn't wasted time at all. and that the solace you get\
is worth it. but just to try your best in fixing it, right?

thanks for reading today's post.\
get some sleep.
