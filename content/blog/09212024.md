what kind of appetizers do you get?

i really like places that just have a thing\
that is the appetizer without paying for it.

i'm talking olive garden bread and cheese,\
or mexican places with chips and salsa.

but when i do have to pay money, if i'm with\
a bunch of boys i do like getting some wings.

if i'm at a ramen place i'll usually get\
some takoyaki, or if i'm at a sushi or\
otherwise asian place, i will definitely\
indulge in a crab rangoon or two.

for some people appetizers add too much in terms of\
calories and the quantity of food being eaten for one meal.

but well.. to that i say:\
live a little.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i could go for some takoyaki actually..
