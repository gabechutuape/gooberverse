i used to not have any physical calendars because i felt i wasn't organized enough to make use of a calendar.

then, at some point, i decided some calendars just look quite neat and they offer value on their own by acting as nice decoration.

i have this one by [helenpeanut](https://thegreatpeanut.bigcartel.com/) featuring Haikyuu!! characters, which is an anime about highschoolers in Japan playing volleyball and trying to be the best in the country. Haikyuu!! is a great anime with music that feels above its class for the media format, and was largely responsible for my interest in sports anime as a whole (i went on to watch Eyeshield 21, Baby Steps, Kuroko's Basketball, Ace of the Diamond, and Yowamushi Pedal).

i also have this one in the office, by Midori, a Japanese stationery brand. it features an Echizen washi paper that is scroll-like an rough to the touch, with different animals each month (that interestingly have almost seemingly nothing to do with the month they are given!)

try something out even if you can't make the best use of it. perfect is the enemy of good.

thanks for reading today's post.\
it's satisfying crossing out the dates!
