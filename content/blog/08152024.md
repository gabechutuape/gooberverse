are you easy-going? or are you a gas-gas-gas type?

nowadays more than ever,\
it's hard to convince yourself to take things easy.\
we live in a culture of go-getters and efficiency.

i believe in the ebb and flow of life's rhythm,\
and in the idea of [equivalent exchange](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange).\
good times simply must follow bad ones.

so when i recognize that times are tough,\
and effort must be exerted to see success,\
i can commit to pushing towards that effort.

but when things are in a lull and the pace is slow,\
i am scarcely convinced that acceleration is the answer.\
instead, those are the moments of relaxation we must savor.

without those moments, you could easily see a life\
spent chasing progress endlessly in the name of\
an *eventual* "early retirement" or some such.

but remember, tomorrow is never guaranteed.\
so enjoy your time while you still have it.\

thanks for reading today's post.\
let's give ourselves the grace to take it easy now and again.
