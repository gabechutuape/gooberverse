what kind of conversation fillers do you use?

i like "right." a lot, as well as "ahh."\
i'll also throw in some inquisitive statements like\
"i didn't know that's how that worked." or\
"wait, really?" that one is huge.

it can be hard sometimes to keep up in\
the deep technical conversations that\
happen at my workplace, so it's a skill\
i've had to work on for a bit now.

my only saving grace is that i make it\
painfully obvious when i don't know\
what the hell is being discussed.\
then i get pity!

thanks for reading today's post.\
yep.. mmhmm.. yeah..
