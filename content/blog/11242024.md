do you have anything in your life\
that you thought you would never get into\
but one day, that all changed?

this most recent presidential election has me\
more interested in consuming political content\
to a degree far greater than ever before in my life.

that is also to say, i used to be of the mind\
that political discussion would simply forever be\
outside of my wheelhouse and that everyone having\
political conversations is essentially just\
parroting what someone else said, without substance.

but now i watch hasanabi videos and listen to\
lex fridman interview people about stuff that\
i used to think i just didn't care about at all.

funny (sadly?) enough, i think its paying dividends\
for nothing else if not just the ability to have\
conversations about this stuff with people as a fallback.

thanks for reading today's post.\
the israeli-palestinian conflict? hmm..
