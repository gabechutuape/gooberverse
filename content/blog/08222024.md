many times we can be rash in our judgments.

i, like many children, argue with my parents.\
we have occasional conflicts in our ideas about life.\
and i have come to understand that the context of their lives\
are key to reaching an understanding of my own.

that is to say, sometimes they just get pissed at me\
because they need something to be pissed at.\
other times, i find genuine merit behind my parents' criticisms.\
but what's most important is that i understand that their concerns,\
for all their trouble, come from a place of care.

understanding *that* gives me the patience i need to see the truth of the matter\
which is that if they didn't care, they wouldn't be concerned.

and when i make a rash judgment and disagree outright because it's not fun being criticized,
that understanding helps me realize that over-analyzing the conflict can be\
the wrong way to go about reaching a resolution that makes both parties happy.

sometimes, it's enough to see that when someone you care about\
wants you to make a change in something you're doing,\
you give up on being right or wrong,\
and you make the change because **you** also care about **them**.

thanks for reading today's post.\
sorry if today's was weirdly personal!
