do you ever think about the stuff\
that is, unfortunately, what makes us\
ultimately human?

for all of the flaws we have,\
they are what makes us unique. our character\
is determined by our upbringing.\
and our biases are controlled by things\
we might not even remember internalizing.

it's neat to psychoanalyze in that way.\
i wouldn't recommend sharing your musings of\
people with the people themselves though.\
they will probably think you're weird.\
it's also quite rude.

that being said, sometimes we can't help it.\
since we're human. we make rash judgments and\
broadstrokes generalizations about people and\
how they treat us and why they do what they do\
and it's.. all just a part of the game.

the stuff of life i suppose.

thanks for reading today's post.\
focus on yourself first..
