i've always liked the term "all-american".

the term has a real definition, of which i'm presently unfamiliar with.
so let's learn together what it means as i go google it.

> The All-America designation is an annual honor bestowed on
> outstanding athletes in the United States who are considered
> to be among the best athletes in their respective sports.
> -Wikipedia article for "All-America"

my basis for liking the term is more rooted in the fact that it is
1, an alliteration. that's good, those are always nice to hear.
and 2, usually when i scroll wikipedia articles at work and i end up
on some exciting read about war crimes or something war-related
it'll be about a guy who happened to be an "all-american" before
they got drafted or whatever.

like ouuu, he's an "all-american". like anybody knows what that means.

anyway.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i liked all-american rejects too, i think...
