do you ever find it interesting how we feel the need to change things up every now and then?

as humans, we crave the new and get bored of the old..

such ingratitude. after all the times the old has saved our lives!\
like when we brush our teeth! or remember to take our meds!

it could be a superpower in its own right to never get bored of something, couldn't it?\
for example, never getting bored of exercising, or never getting bored of work.\
can you learn that or train yourself to be that way?

psychological tricks are all the rage nowadays in [self-help books](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299), and honestly i get it!
who wouldn't want to have dominion over their life by just doing things a certain way?

in my case, i was bored of [ffxiv](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/) maybe because i had just been\
playing it for so long that it wasn't new or exciting to me.

but now that dawntrail is out, it's new and exciting again.\
but what about all the time i already put into it?\
was the time spent the minimum amount of value i could ask to get out of it?\
should i be grateful for that and that alone?

my stance on it right now...

yeah,\
maybe i'm asking too much of it.\
it's done a lot for me already.

and i heard being grateful for anything, no matter how small,\
can be a key ingredient to being able to reach the end of your journey,\
with a smile on your face.

thank you for reading today's post.\
sorry if it seems a little scattered; serious binge gaming nights recently with dawntrail.
