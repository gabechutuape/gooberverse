do you ever lose your sense of hunger when focused?

i think it's super interesting that this happens.\
[dr. k](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClHVl2N3jPEbkNJVx-ItQIQ) spoke about this once in the lens of ayurvedic teaching.

something along the lines of your attention being a limited resource,\
like you have 100 attention points to spend on any amount of things at a time.

so if you manage to focus so intently on one thing,\
you actually minimize the capacity to have your attention grabbed\
by things even as fundamentally necessary as hunger!

this most often happens to me while i'm playing video games,\
since it's a fairly low physical activity output but can actually\
have surprisingly high mental activity output.

a few hours later, and you're sitting at your desk wondering:\
"..when's the last time i ate..?"

for me, that's right now after doing FFXIV raids.

it's a fun effect that you may notice..\
i don't necessarily recommend starving yourself via gaming, however.

thanks for reading today's post.\
did you eat today?
