i've said it before and i'll say it again:
i owe ghost energy drinks my bachelor's degree.

ghost energy drinks were marketed to me originally in 2020/2021
as hype with specific ingredients that touted the idea of
more focused brain activity for lengthy durations of time,
which was the perfect thing for a guy pulling late nighters
in college like me.

(not because i was studying particularly hard, but rather because
reconciling the lifestyle of a gamer with the necessity of
being a university-level engineering student came with its
fair share of problems that affected my sleep heavily.)

i try not to drink them nowadays because they do truly give
a boundless amount of energy, but more because they make your
soul feel decrepit after you've drank one. it's the lingering
and nauseating taste of sugar substitutes that inhabits your tongue
even hours after you've finished drinking one that reminds you
of the price you've paid for energy.

i needed it because i fucked my sleep schedule so ass backwards
talking to a girl i like and staying up late at night that
i was falling asleep essentially mid-day.

so... i'm gonna say that that's a good use of it.

thanks for reading today's post.
i can still taste it, even now, over 12 hours later...
