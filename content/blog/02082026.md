have you ever heard of "frutiger aero"?

it describes a cultural period of digital design where things\
are very airy, breathable, nature-inspired, mixing the advent of\
early 2000s technology with clean and fresh colors like\
light blues and greens, whites, and oranges,\
all while not compromising towards a minimalist design\
and instead emphasizing glossy textures, big buttons,\
and the idea of "future" in the same sense you might get from\
staring at the default background for Windows Vista.

frutiger aero extends in visual language to audio language\
in the form of the music that existed at the same time period\
as the Wii. indeed, the sounds used for sound effects and menus\
for the Wii are core frutiger aero references and it's why you'll\
see videos titled "Nintendo frutiger aero mix vol. 2" on YouTube\
with thousands of views. people yearn for that aesthetic.

i think the theme personally for me gets a little tiring quickly,\
but i must say: when you're in the mood for that pre-2010 vibe\
there's few things that hit quite as good.

thanks for reading today's post.\
it's a crime that the switch doesn't have music like the Wii did.
