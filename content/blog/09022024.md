is today trash day for you?

in our neighborhood, trash day is monday.\
so, taking out the trash gets added to my sunday list of chores.\
it's not a particularly long list, usually just laundry and trash.

for a long time taking out the trash was not habitual,\
and i would often forget to do it on sundays.\
when i was on campus, this wouldn't really matter, since\
the trash just goes to the bin behind the apartment.

in the suburbs, of course, trash is picked up.\
so we live and die by the schedule.

the routine parts of the days of the week\
give a nice structure to things.

thanks for reading today's post.\
unscented bags are always better than scented.
