what is an american breakfast to you?

to a lot of american diner restaurants,
it means pancakes, bacon, eggs, sausages, hash browns, and even sandwiches.
and even among that, what kind of eggs? sausage links or sausage patties? grits or hash browns?
let's not even bother getting into the amount of things you can add to pancakes, and
the varieties of breakfast sandwiches and pastries exist.

the amount of variety is endless. not literally, of course, but practically.

my classical american breakfast is the first three items i listed:
pancakes, bacon, and eggs. the only problem being that most bacon i find at
restaurants out in the wild are wholly dissastisfactory, in size and crispiness.
it's almost astounding. the only place i can imagine that has "good" bacon is Five Guys,
and that isn't even a burger place.

anyway, i just had some bacon and eggs. and rice, since i'm filipino.

thanks for reading today's post.
pancakes are a little too much of a hassle for home cooking.
