i love the feeling of having a fresh haircut.

all those days or weeks of building up to getting one,\
and the anticipation of when you feel it's *just right* to get one\
is finally released.

for my asian hair, when it gets too long (for my liking)\
it grows outwards pretty obtusely on the back and sides.

so i prefer having a taper fade of some kind to keep those sides short.\
my balding ass, however, keeps the top with enough to move around.

basically, when i have longer hair, i almost strictly dislike how i look more often,\
and my attitude towards how i feel about my hair looking linearly decreases\
as duration of time from the last haircut increases.

i used to go to GreatClips for how cheap they were,\
but then i realized a local salon in my HMart does a better job\
with the intricacies of my asian hair.

it's like $30 a cut, which is definitely more than the $15 or so\
i was paying at GreatClips. but now i don't have to tell people\
"..yeah.. i get my hair cut at greatclips". that shit was embarrassing.

i can be like "yeah i go to a local place" like a guy who knows about his community,\
and for the main part, it gets to look better than the old place!

thanks for reading today's post.\
how often do you get your hair cut? i'm usually every month or so.
