have you ever heard of an "iced capp"?

the naive among you may think,\
"that's an iced cappuccino."

nay, i say. neigh.\
the "iced capp" specifically refers to\
the coffee-flavored dessert-like beverage\
offered by Canadian fast food chain Tim Horton's.

it's a delicious concoction of blended ice\
and the flavors of coffee (and actual caffeine to boot).

since Tim Horton's is not commonly found in the US,\
i haven't had an iced capp since i went to Canada\
august of last year, 2023. 

i've missed them for a while, until i realized:\
if i could find a place that sold coffee-flavored\
blended ice mixed with some kind of creaminess element,\
i would have an iced capp (basically).

luckily, i live near a Chi Tea, which offers\
blended boba drinks, one flavor of which is *Mocha*!\
i get mine with lychee jelly, which tastes kind of weird,\
but i like the duality of the flavors between\
the mature mocha and the sweet lychee.

anyway, this is my working substitute for\
the famous Tim Horton's iced capp in the US.

thanks for reading today's post.\
if you get the chance, try an "iced capp" from timmies.
