if you learn how to do something,\
have you ever noticed how it feels like\
you get a little "worse" at it?

when you accomplish a hard thing and finally\
reach your goal, if you want to do that same thing\
again you end up not being able to meet that\
expectation despite having provably done it before.

what happened? subconsciously, you got complacent.\
the part of your brain that had a drive for wanting\
to see that first achievement of its kind is dead,\
because, well, you've already done it.

unless you can fool your brain into thinking that\
multiple successes is the only singular success,\
then it can be hard to break out of a loop like this.

so, i try to always be vigilant of when it feels\
like i'm taking the easy way out of something.\
it keeps things more interesting that way.

thanks for reading today's post.\
