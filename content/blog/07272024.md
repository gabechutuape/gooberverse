you ever go on facebook marketplace and lowball people?

this is some of the funniest shit ever, i think.\
a lot of funny things are based in suffering, either your own\
or other peoples' (inflicted either by you or by the universe.)

i'm in the market for a PS5 and i have a buddy on the lookout,\
but in the meantime i'm also checking facebook marketplace,\
and brother am i lowballing.

it's part of the game, right?\
nobody is gonna buy for the list price.\
at least, i HOPE nobody is gonna buy for list price.\
at that point you might as well buy new.

so we do the song and dance,\
25%-50% lower than list price,\
then the seller counter-offers,\
and then MAYBE the buyer re-counters or accepts.

it's just the way of the world.

some people i've seen make content out of this for instagram,\
where they spray-n-pray lowballing people,\
probably not even intending to buy the shit they're messaging for!

THIS is comedy.

thanks for reading today's post.\
as funny as it is, i would hate to be a facebook marketplace seller\
dealing with assholes like me..
