today on january 6th 2026, the new savage tier of ffxiv released.

for the uninitiated, this means ffxiv players are quite happy today.
some players get to spend more time with their "static",
a dedicated group of raid buddies. other people will be slumming it
in "Party Finder", making the most of their time with randoms.

i spend a lot of time raiding in ffxiv, so this is exciting for me.
not enough to take time off of work like some people do,
but still exciting enough to consume most of my passive time
at work watching livestreams of people doing the new content.

if you or a loved one is raiding this season,
please wish them the best of luck.

thanks for reading today's post.
i'm in a static, by the way.
