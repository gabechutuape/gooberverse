when you reach tomorrow, it becomes today.

isn't it fucked up how we'll never see tomorrow?\
it's all dependent on your frame of reference.\
the buddhists say that being present and finding yourself in the present\
is the key to avoiding the anxiety of the future and the grief of the past.

i'm a big fan of that ideology. we can only really do something today,\
here and now. there is no tomorrow waiting for us in the sense of\
where we are and what we can do.

that being said, i'm clearly looking forward to tomorrow.\
i got plenty of things to look forward to tomorrow.\
i get to eat out with my coworkers tomorrow,\
and the day after tomorrow is friday so i get to fuck off work for the weekend after.

so it just depends on how deep you wanna get with it.

thanks for reading today's post.\
don't even get me started on yesterday.
