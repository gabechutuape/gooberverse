if you're unfamiliar with why that achievement matters,\
allow me to explain.

FFXIV Ultimates are a type of raid taken on by 8 players.\
they are denoted as "Ultimate" as opposed to "Savage",\
which is a different tier of raid difficulty, or "Extreme",\
which is another different tier of difficulty.

in order from least difficult to most difficult, it goes\
"Extreme", "Savage", and "Ultimate". not all fights come out\
with all three different difficulty levels, but there are fights\
released with those different designations of difficulty.

An Ultimate raid in FFXIV will have you performing in-game\
mechanics such as dodging AOEs and puzzle-solving, to meeting\
DPS checks, to performing proper damage mitigation,\
all for a straight 19 or so minutes of concentrated effort.

it usually takes people weeks to months to clear Ultimate raids,\
and our group landed at 1 month and some change.\
i was raiding with my group, called a "Static", that did the\
"Savage" difficulty tier of four raids that came out with\
for the Dawntrail expansion release. 

three of us (out of eight) were entirely new to Ultimate raiding\
and had never even attempted it in the past. overall,\
i'm pretty proud of the progress we made in the short time we had.\
our deadline was this upcoming Sunday to clear, and we did it.

studying this fight and practicing has taken up the better amount\
of my free time for literally the last 5 or 6 weeks.\
i've had dreams about it, nightmares about it, slacked off at work because of it,\
and everything in between. it's been a wild ride. and it's finally over.

thanks for reading today's post.\
