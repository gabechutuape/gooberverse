"phoning it in" is a hilarious term to me.

do i know the etymology of it? no, but\
i like to believe that sayings like this\
that i don't know the origin of can reach\
new ceilings of potential hilarity from\
the headcanon i can assign to it.

for example, the reason i know what "phoning it in"\
is is because i went to UIUC, where Coach Lovie of our\
school's football team, was notoriously known for\
you guessed it, phoning it in with coaching.

it's a euphemism of some kind. which is to say\
that it attempts to mask its true meaning behind one\
that can be colloquially interpreted: and that's Fun.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i'm phoning it in right now!
