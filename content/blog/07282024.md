do you ever go somewhere to eat on your own?

it feels a little weird, right?\
we're very used to going with at least one other person,\
or at least i do that a lot of the time.

i recently went to mitsuwa in Arlington Heights\
to get some pictures on my rental Fujifilm X-T30II.

while i was there, i noticed how the entire atmosphere of the store,\
which i usually find quite bustling and "romantic",\
felt.. a little less alive than normal.

this is definitely in part due to not being there with someone else,\
and i still had a good time despite that,\
because of the unique feeling i had in those moments.

it was like being a spectator to everyone else's lives being\
the main objective made it feel like a totally different vibe.

in general, i like to find the confidence to go to places solo,\
rather than using friends or others as an excuse to go somewhere.

it makes it feel like i have more conviction doing it,\
like it's something i really want to do.

and in the end, i was still able to get some pictures i'm happy with.
