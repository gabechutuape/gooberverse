in FFXIV, there's some content called "Island Sanctuary",\
wherein you receive an island all to yourself, and its your job\
to build it up, decorate it, and generating money so that you\
can claim all the cool glamours that are gated behind it.

you do everything from gathering materials for buildings,\
scheduling manufacturing export schedules to make money,\
cultivating plants and nurturing wildlife, and placing\
building landmarks, workshops, and other buildings, all while\
ordering around mammets (robot automatons) to do your bidding.

i started up this grind today (as many of the pieces of content in\
FFXIV are affectionately referred to as) and am enjoying my time.\
it's one of those pieces of Endwalker content that i skipped past\
since i didn't really do any post-Endwalker at that point in my life.

i'm having fun mindlessly gathering stuff. it's a great change of pace\
from doing ultimate prog every single day for the last 30 days straight,\
which is a record that i am happy to leave at that (breaking the streak today).

thanks for reading today's post.\
minions are a nice thing to have.
