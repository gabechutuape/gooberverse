my cousins were over recently for my mom's birthday,\
and one of their two year olds is a whirlwind of a human.

not only did they (not necessarily the two year old,\
but including the parents of the two year old) show\
complete disregard for any form of order in terms of\
how things were arranged prior to their arrival,\
but they also managed to leave the place in a state\
of *active disrepair* following their visit!

my once functioning sliding glass door entrance\
to my shower in my bathroom is now off-axis, and no\
longer slides in either direction. i am at least thankful\
that it is stuck on the side that stops shower water\
from rampantly spilling out the sides while in use.

after reflecting on my exasperation i thought to myself,\
maybe parents of newborns learn to abandon the idea of\
anything having a sort of neat order to it and instead\
embrace the chaos that will naturally be wrought about\
by their child.

what a mess.

thanks for reading today's post.\
it's not the end of the world, though.
