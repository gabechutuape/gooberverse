you ever go to a symphony orchestra concert?

as a final fantasy fan, i've had the opportunity to go\
to a few "Distant Worlds" performances at the\
Chicago Symphony Center on Michigan Avenue.

today, i went to see the FF7 Rebirth Symphony Orchestra\
on their second date of their worldwide tour!\
i had the pleasure of going with a couple of friends.

i was trying to find interesting pictures to take\
while i was in the orchestra hall, but nothing really stood out.

but although i wasn't able to get the neat picture i dreamed of,\
i still had a great time. orchestra concerts are fun because you can\
somewhat pedantically comment on the volume of the choir,\
or the brass section, or on how just absolutely *stunning*\
that first chair violinist is doing.

it doesn't need to be complex, and you don't need to have a\
"deep" appreciation of different instruments.\
it can be enough to just wanna go because you\
happen to know about the source material.

i recommend going to an orchestra show if you get the chance.

thanks for reading today's post.\
don't even need to dress fancy for video game orchestras as a bonus!
