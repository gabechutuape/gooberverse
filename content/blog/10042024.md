remember the Nintendo GameCube?

the GameCube was host to many legendary Nintendo titles,\
like Super Smash Bros. Melee and Mario Kart Double Dash.

however, if you ask me what was a standout hit from that time,\
i've gotta go with The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker.

| *Link in Wind Waker, riding the King of Red Lions.* |

in Wind Waker, you control Link as he navigates across the seas\
in a talking boat called the King of Red Lions. in reality,\
the King of Red Lions is the fallen King of Hyrule, and your task\
is to restore him to his former glory (since you are, after all,\
the Triforce of Courage, and it is your destiny, yadda yadda.)

it was the first Legend of Zelda game to use this toon-y art style\
to middling reception at the time, but it got a cult following among fans\
such as myself, who were also pleased to see Toon Link appearing in\
future iterations of the Super Smash Bros. series.

charming graphics, unforgettable tunes, and the classic\
Legend of Zelda dungeon/temple experience: what's not to love?\
wind waker was definitely one of the best.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i didn't ever play the HD remake, however..
