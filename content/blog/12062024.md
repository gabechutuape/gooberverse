have you ever felt the phrase,\
"you are what you eat" feel like\
it's really the damn truth?

i don't eat potato chips often.\
but when i do, i almost invariably\
feel like shit afterwards.

call my metabolic functions terrible;\
some people can eat chips and it's just fuel in.\
no difference between that and anything else.

but for me, i get some chips in me\
and i feel mentally sluggish,\
my reaction is slower, and my brain\
is foggier, and i'm just.. tired.

is the juice worth the squeeze...?\
every now and again.. maybe.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i gotta have some vegetables, man..
