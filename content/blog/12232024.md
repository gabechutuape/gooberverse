how do you present yourself?\
in your speech, attitude, clothing,\
all these external signals that we give off\
to the world without even realizing\
(or maybe on purpose.)

when i'm among friends + 1 new guy,\
who is probably friends with one of my friends,\
i like to keep the atmosphere chill by\
being a little more emotional than normal in terms\
of how i tell stories or ham up things.

for example, if i'm describing a gaming session,\
i'll act like i was robbed of something great and\
that everyone else is bad or something or that i\
know the way of the world and all things that should be.

why do i do this? i like to think that it exposes me as\
someone who isn't like, a normal automaton who sticks to\
conventional conversation topics that aren't particularly\
exciting to discuss or witness discussion of.

but maybe i just sound like a tool.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i'm just a chill guy, you know..
