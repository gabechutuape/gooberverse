never underestimate the calming feeling\
brought about by being in a safe space.

safe spaces can be anything from being\
with people you're comfortable with to\
being by yourself in a place you know you\
won't be bothered by anybody.

(if you aren't comfortable by yourself,\
you got bigger problems to deal with than\
interpreting the meaning of this blogpost.)

i have a little spot at work i like to hang\
out in when the main office gets a little too\
loud and rackety. it always calms me down to\
steal a few minutes going there and sitting,\
doing nothing but scrolling or closing my eyes.

definitely find a spot if you're not\
being clocked by your workplace, 100%.

thanks for reading today's post.\
naps are great, right?
