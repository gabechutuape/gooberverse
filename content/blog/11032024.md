it can be an important thing to recognize\
when your effort into a thing does not necessarily\
equal the results you want out of it.

there is absolutely a point of diminishing returns\
on many things in the real world, (which is not to\
speak about video game logic where that might not be the case.)

i'm banging my head against the wall joining random parties\
in FFXIV's Party Finder system to find people to do\
The Omega Protocol (Ultimate) with, and while i was building\
consistency in mechanical execution before, i've reached a point\
where it feels more like a waste of time than a gain on performance.

so, evaluating this, i'm deciding that my efforts are probably\
more efficiently spent elsewhere. now, i still somewhat enjoy\
going through the slog of shared suffering with people,\
and there is definitely something to be said about living a life\
that isn't strictly about pursuing efficiency.

but yeah shits getting tiring.

thanks for reading today's post.\
of course, i'm not the problem. clearly.
