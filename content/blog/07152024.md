have you ever felt compelled to do something\
strictly off of an audio or visual cue?

it's interesting how [pavlovian conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) still holds up\
to this day, for mammals as advanced as humans are.

using cues like these can help you build habits\
like remembering to brush your teeth, or to drink water.

in my case, however, it's a bit annoying.

it seems at some point i formed an visual/auditory cue\
with running water to want to urinate.

i'd say this is a pretty classic one, you see it in TV all the time.

the reason it's a problem for me is\
because i go into the restroom to wash my hands\
and THEN i feel the need to go number 1.

so then i have to wash my hands again.

curses, classical conditioning..

thanks for reading today's post.\
..what was that noise behind you?
