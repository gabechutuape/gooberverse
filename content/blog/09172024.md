did you play browser games when you were younger?

i'm not sure if kids these days play browser games anymore.\
but i'm talking websites like addictinggames.com,\
stickpage.com, kongregate.com, and armorgames.com.

i would go on these sites after school in elementary\
and just play random bullshit games for hours.\
it was awesome.

you might have even heard of andyslife.org,\
which is the secret site we had to use at catholic school\
because it wasn't blocked by the IT firewall.

browser games like raft wars, stick RPG, and\
cookie clicker were kind of the shit back in the day.

i fear that time of the internet has come and gone, though.\
blessed are we to have partaken in it.

thanks for reading today's post.\
