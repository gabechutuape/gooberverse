tonight, i'm listening to ["eastbound and down" by WSTR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARZZpNUDT6Y).

it appears it's a song named after a comedy series that aired back in the early 2010s,\
but i just know it as the song that i found while i was trying to build a pop punk playlist.

the thing about pop punk in general that i appreciate more than heavier stuff is that\
i think the lighter melodies and hooks are easier to latch onto, i.e., the "pop" part.

it's also got all the great self-deprecating language that all emo-adjacent music\
has for the listener to relate to. everyone hates me, you're better off without me, etc.

i like listening to pop punk like this when i feel a bit lonely.\
it helps me feel like the main character again, which is silly, but\
come on man. let me live.

thanks for reading today's post.\
