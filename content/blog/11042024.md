have you ever had Jollibee?

Jollibee is a filipino fast food chain known\
for their fried chicken, peach mango pies,\
and their spaghetti served with hotdogs\
(as is the custom in the Philippines.).

i used to not be super hyped on Jollibee;\
i've had it a few times in New York and\
a few more times while in the actual motherland.

but i recently found out that one of my friends'\
apartments is 15 minutes away from a Jollibee, so\
i drop by to bring some home because Popeyes prices\
are frankly exorbitant nowadays, and man.

it is great. and it's served with gravy.\
the filipino way. i'm honestly amazed this shit\
didn't catch on in america any faster. do you know\
how amazing chicken with gravy is? it's the best.

i'm not sure what changed, maybe it's the place\
i'm getting it from, but i find the taste is just\
hitting the spot nowadays.

go have some Jollibee.

thanks for reading today's post.\
unless of course you don't like fried chicken.
