it's a rather tired topic but i'm in one of those periods of life\
where the afternoons and evenings slip through your fingers like nothing.

they say how you spend each day is how you spend your life,\
and as someone who gets home from work and\
lays on the couch for an hour or so, then proceeds to play video games\
until it's time to go to bed, i must say that honestly...\
it's not all that bad. in some ways, this is an extremely\
luxurious life to be living, that i'm not worried about things like\
my health or the trajectory of my career or how i'm going to pay bills.

finding gratitude that i don't have to worry about those things has always\
been a weird thing for me. i think we spend our entire lives being thankful\
for the things that we are afforded by circumstances out of our control\
that are beneficial to us, like living in a stable household or having a job.\
we also spend our entire lives wondering if us "being thankful" is ever enough.

me personally, it's comfortable. i'm okay with it. they say you should\
avoid stagnation whenever possible, but in the tumult of today's cultural landscape\
i'm quite happy being on the couch right now, frankly.

thanks for reading today's post.\
maybe to be like this means they They won...
