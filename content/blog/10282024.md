the great combiner, that which brings\
all people of the office together: donuts.

visitors are in town this week (people who usually\
work off-site but are mandated to visit monthly)\
so i had the bright idea of buying donuts for them.

unfortunately i bought too few donuts, but my concerns\
went noticed and were allayed by my senior coworker who\
fixed the problem with one simple trick: buy more donuts.

the lesson i learned? complaining, unfortunately works\
in terms of problem solving at least some of the time.\
also, munchkins are a great thing that i don't give enough credit.

thanks for reading today's post.\
be the office hero. give dunkin your money.
