you ever met a person who said,\
"actually i'm great with confrontation?"\
hell no, everyone is like "i'm really bad\
with confrontation and its scary."

i think confrontation is a necessary evil,\
and the sooner you acknowledge that the sooner\
you can get down to getting real value out of\
raising your concerns to someone. i fear that what\
happens to people who claim to be "bad" with\
confrontation is that they avoid it when in reality\
it's a valuable social tool for setting up\
boundaries that you and another party respect mutually.

which is to say, when confrontation is avoided,\
eventually someone needs to step in to reach\
conflict resolution in some capacity if the\
relationship is to be maintained or recovered.

now that's some difficult shit, is being\
a conflict resolver. compromise between humans\
is all we can do when we don't understand one another,\
but it takes two to acknowledge when their differences\
aren't worth the value of the relationship they have.

it would be nice if we could all reach that level\
of understanding with one another: to understand that\
there will always be things we can't understand.

thanks for reading today's post.\
let's all just get along now, shall we?
