you ever go to work and just have an absolute poopoo day?

i've been thinking about how i self-medicate shit days.\
usually it's just indulgence in some form..\
like ordering takeout or gaming or sleeping.. 

work today was kind of a bummer so i went to my local\
boba place to get a mocha milk tea to get the vibes going again.

but it got me thinking,\
should i just simply feel bad when it's a bad day\
and own that feeling? or should i oppose it\
and go get myself a little treat for enduring it?

much to consider.\
i think enduring it is more "spiritually" healthy,\
but i can't argue with a little treat:\
it sure does feel good to have something nice.

thanks for reading today's post.\
maybe YOU should have a little treat too!
