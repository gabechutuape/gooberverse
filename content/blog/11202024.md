my thing with crab legs as food is that\
it feels like it's a lot of work to pry open.

when i was a kid, with my soft baby hands,\
i wasn't able to open crab legs and so i never\
grew and interest in eating crabs even though\
they're a classic filipino food, the seafarers that they are.

as an adult now, i realize that inanimate crab shells\
pose basically no threat to me and i can crack them open\
with a little bit of elbow grease. 

that being said,\
i've never been a fan of seafood for the simple reason\
that it feels like its fighting back when you're\
trying to eat it. crab legs need prying open,\
and fish bones are getting stuck everywhere.\
it's a mess.

but after having some crab today with a nice\
garlic butter and lemon sauce, i can see clearly\
that i was missing out. it's worth the effort.

the lesson? don't knock it till you try it.\
and do give it an HONEST try.

thanks for reading today's post.\
