one time when i was in high school,\
i described the air as "sharp".

it was a description of how it felt to breathe extremely cold air\
into your nose with the massive temperature difference and speed\
of inhalation almost making it feel like a cut inside your nose.

i like the weirdly precise descriptors we have for temperature\
like that. the air was sharp, it's bitingly cold, it's hot as balls.
they make things more fun.

thanks for reading today's post.\
it is so cold in illinois right now.
