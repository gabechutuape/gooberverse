i've been having a bunch of coffee recently.\
more than usual, that is. my usual is a single cup\
in the morning, diluted halfway to the volume of\
the cup with hot water.

as an aside, i've had great success diluting the coffee\
brewed at work with water. it just.. tastes less strong\
to where you can actually appreciate it a bit more.

anyway, i've been having a morning cup and an evening cup.\
and sometimes even a post or pre-lunch cup. it's crazy.\
i'm going off the rails. what happened to being a human?

at some point, you gotta decide for yourself whether\
or not you actually feel bad about the thing you're doing.\
it doesn't do you any favors to drag your feet with it,\
and it doesn't help your mentality to blame itself for something\
it truly doesn't care about getting wrong.

so i say, take the blame if you think it'll help.\
should i feel bad that i'm having more coffee than usual?\
i'm gonna say, no. it's a product of my behaviors.

thanks for reading today's post.\
whatever helps you sleep at night.
