you ever seen the video\
"animator vs. animation"?

it was a legendary youtube video in that era\
of youtube videos back when people shared them\
word of mouth (as opposed to like, tiktoks).

i was almost inspired to learn cs5 flash,\
the animating software made by adobe that's\
featured in the video, wherein a mouse cursor\
(the animator) fights a stick guy he drew (animation).

i miss the days of those classic youtube videos.\
stuff like "salad fingers", "haloid", and "orphan tears."\
not that i vouch for ray William johnson, or anything.

thanks for reading today's post.\
nostalgia bites..
