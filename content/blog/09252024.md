today i finished disco elysium!

it was a thoughtful and beautiful game.\
easily my top 5 of all time.

in the beginning of playing this game,\
i thought that the dialogue was unwieldy\
and laborious to read, that it was somehow\
something that "ought to be unnecessary."

this was conditioning from the previous games i had played,\
which, despite having narratives i can stand behind,\
simply were not up to the standard of disco's writing.

the in-game impressionist art portraits are\
a joy to behold, and the wild thoughts of\
harry's aspects will be sticking around in my own brain\
for a while after having finished the game.

i feel like i had a pretty fulfilling playthrough.\
i was supervised by a friend who is a disco superfan,\
and the experience was so enjoyable i lamented\
that it would need to end someday as the end of the game\
would surely arrive (apocalypse cop).

thanks for reading today's post.\
i guess this is my personality for the next few weeks.
