have you ever listened to a [touhou bossa nova mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lCNYNyC54o)?

touhou is a japanese bullet hell video game series\
with a shitload of lore (?) and a bunch of characters.\
it apparently also has jazz and bossa nova music.

if i could describe touhou in one word, it would be "eternal".\
touhou has felt like it's had its own corner of the internet\
since i remember logging on to 4chan the first time in 2010.

originally, i only knew it as the video game.\
but then eventually, i found out they had some sweet\
jazz and bossa nova music associated with them.\
haven't played a single game, and i don't know why\
they have this music at all.. is it fanmade maybe?

i use them as background music when i'm playing XIV nowadays.\
they're great, easy, casual listens. i recommend the first link,\
and also [toho jazz messengers girls apartment 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUVoBFl3ckA&t=1520s).

thanks for reading today's post.\
i still don't know a single character's name..
