the last week of december and the first week of january i was lucky enough to have\
two four day weekends in a row. which, as you might be able to guess, was absolutely\
terrible for work morale. coming back to work has been a slog. but such is the way\
of government-observed holidays.

these days, fridays feel so great. there was a tweet that would get reposted\
every friday saying ["it's the freaking weeking, babey!!"](https://x.com/freakingweeking?lang=en) featuring a picture\
of the pokemon Weeking. silly little thing. i liked seeing it. haven't seen it in a while.

it's not like working itself is a drag. i just miss sleeping in and stuff.\
it's a bit of a shame how life is just chasing work days and relaxation days\
back and forth. they give each other value, though, so ultimately i guess it balances out.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i'm going horizontal.
