does anyone like mondays?

i mean aside from like, david goggins i guess.\
he probably also doesn't like mondays but he like..\
uses the fuel of people hating mondays to do MORE shit on mondays.

mondays are a complete struggle for me, as they are for many.

switching gears from weekend gaming (or other social activities)\
back to work and how to get stuff done at work,\
on top of figuring out where the hell you were last week..

it takes a lot of energy.

usually the only solace i can take in mondays\
is in the understanding that a journey of a thousand miles\
begins with a single step.

and in order to reach the promised land of the Saturdays,\
we must first tolerate monday.

thanks for reading today's post.\
this week, let's all strive to take the first step.
