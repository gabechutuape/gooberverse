in the world of Warhammer 40k,\
there is a man called Roboute Guilliman.\
(pronounced roo-boot, gill-ih-man)

Guilliman is a master strategist and leader of men,\
revered for his universal pragmatism and resourcefulness.

one of his famed thought practices is the\
"theoretical, practical" approach to problem-solving.

the process goes like this: state a problem you have\
as the "theoretical". then, name states of reality or\
solutions pertaining to the problem that you can accomplish.

for example:\
theoretical: i need to take a shit.\
practical: i can go to the bathroom.\
practical: i can shit my pants.\
practical: i can defer this task by holding it in.

by listing out your options in a clear format,\
you gauge the possibilities without entertaining\
ideas that are simply impossible (i refuse to take a shit).

it's not particularly outstanding or anything,\
i think most humans do this automatically.\
but it's a neat little thing that they have in 40K\
that just sounds cool. *theoretical. practical.*

thanks for reading today's post.\
practical: i should go to sleep to be rested for work tomorrow.
