i'm pretty bad with my sleep schedule.

i think i've written about this one before\
but it bears repeating because it is so pervasive of a problem for me.

how do you reconcile staying up because the rest of the world is up\
playing games and having fun\
with needing to be up the next day?

at some point, something has to give.\
i wonder when that time will come for me.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i'm strictly nocturnal.
