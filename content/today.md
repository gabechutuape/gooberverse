are you a console gamer?

for a while i would have random thoughts of\
being someone who plays games on a console\
in addition to playing PC games.

just seemed like a good mix. like a healthy balance.\
"i can do console exclusives AND play PC games with friends.\
win win situation! aside from buying the console."

i wanted to grab a PS5 when they came out but\
obviously supply chain issues stepped in\
and also i didn't have a TV for it yet.

but i bought an LG B2 OLED in 55inch\
and have been enjoying using my room for watching\
anime, TV shows, and YouTube a lot.

but anyway, since i have to play FFVII Rebirth,\
i finally had to buy a PS5. so here it is.

and i've been having a great time with it!\
the PS5 is like that little caesar's meme:

> ps5 is so good when it aint got a bitch in ya ear
> tellin you it's nasty

thanks for reading today's post.\
maybe i'll play persona 3 reload on the ps5 as well..
