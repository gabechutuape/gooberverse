when September rolls around is when i start thinking that seasons are changing.

persona 3 has a [great track called changing of the seasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQCAv3oKoN8) that i think of this time of year (although in-game, this track doesn't play around September.)

my 2nd favorite season is probably fall, next to winter. the red and orange colored leaves are just amazing to look at. makes you feel young when you drive underneath trees like that.

i know the real change of seasons are an equinox thing, but for me, it's usually September. or maybe mid-September.

i wonder what this last fourth of the year has in store?

thanks for reading today's post.\
what's your favorite season?
