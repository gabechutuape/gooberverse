the current keyboard i use is the [Realforce R2 Tenkeyless](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-r2-ivory) in the ivory colorway.

in the beginning of my keyboard journey, i started with a Leopold FC750R.\
also a tenkeyless, but with mechanical switches instead of [Topre](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Topre_switch) switches.

i originally purchased it after hearing about the Leopold FC660C,\
and being confused as to why it was so expensive,\
but still wanting the Leopold name behind my typing instrument of choice.

the next keyboard i got after that was a [Niz Plum x87](https://www.nizkeyboard.com/products/niz-2019-new-x87-electro-capacitive-bluetooth-keyboard-non-rgb-white-black),\
featuring "Nopre" switches (fake Topre that was much softer to the touch).

although i enjoyed my Niz and its quiet smoothness,\
something was gnawing at me that i hadn't found "the one" yet.

so i embarked on a few thousand dollar keyboard journey of investigating:
- switch and stabilizer modding including lubing, filming, and band-aids
- custom keyboard kits
- GMK, PBT, KAT, keycaps of all kinds

there were some strong contenders, including my [QK65 with sunny side up linears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5h_mqy-rGE).\
i'm still happy to go with this board almost any day of the week.

but looking to return to form, with a salary in hand,\
i opted for one of the most timeless Topre keyboards:\
the Realforce R2 (with 55g weighted switches).

the weight curve of the switch press has a strong initial force requirement,\
and glides smoothly after overcoming that first press,\
but still fights back at a little at the bottom out.

it is, in my opinion, my *perfect* switch feel. i'm serious.\
*(in person, nobody has ever agreed with me on this one.)*

that being said, i plan on building a grail keyboard of sorts soon:\
a Leopold FC660C (remember him?) with a [Norbauer aftermarket case](https://www.norbauer.co/products/the-heavy-6-mark-ii?variant=47887019409716).

for reference, [Ryan Norbauer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIvqFsXu4xg) makes bespoke Topre aftermarket bodies\
that are revered for their quality and commitment to detail.

i'm interested to see how it will turn out..\
and i actually doubt it'll replace my realforce as a daily driver.

but it will definitely be a dream come true to the me of the past! (─‿─)

thanks for reading today's post.\
to be honest, i'd type on pretty much anything but an apple keyboard..
