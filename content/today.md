what do you think of doing laundry?

i know some people who can't stand laundry,\
and they need their s/o or somebody else to do it for them,\
or they will otherwise do it with great mental stress.

for me, laundry is kind of relaxing.

it's nice to set things and forget them,\
come back later,\
and see that they've made progress.

i also think there is a quiet respite to be found\
in the time we spend folding laundry.

nobody expects anything of you when you're folding laundry,\
and your time is all your own when you're doing it, in a way.

there are other things that make me feel this way,\
like being up at 3am, or on a late night drive outside,\
or being alone doing something.

it's quite liberating to not be on anybody else's schedule.\
and for as much as i enjoy making the most of the time i have\
with the people i care the most about,\
that time of peace, laundry day, is just as important.

thank you for reading today's post.\
my laundry machines play a jingle when they finish. i like it!
