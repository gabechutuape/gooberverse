you ever do something you know you shouldn't be doing?

i'm currently playing through Final Fantasy VII Rebirth,\
a game with over a hundred hours of content inside,\
but also holding the capability to be finished in under 30 hours.

my reason for playing this game is because i have a concert\
for the FFVII Rebirth Orchestra this saturday the 17th\
wherein spoilers for the game will be shown.

therefore, i need to complete the game as fast as possible\
to make sure that my playing experience remains spoiler-free.

that being said, i have been undertaking some annoying\
yet intriguing distractions along the way in the game.

this is the part of the post where i would normally\
summon some scheme of logic that combats these impulsive desires,\
and yet today.. i find myself at a loss.

in general, i would say that these situations\
exist in spite of logic, driven largely by emotion,\
but serve a unique, if subversive, purpose of their own.

i spent nearly an hour doing an optional fight for meagre rewards\
save bragging rights and the feeling of triumph.\
and i am now, plainly, an hour behind schedule.

i guess in moments like these,\
despite not being closer to the original goal,

i take solace in the fact
that the time i spend enjoying myself\
is time not wasted at all.

thanks for reading today's post.\
i can do this.. i can do this..
