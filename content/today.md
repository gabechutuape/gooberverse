remember how [last time i talked about photography](https://www.gooberverse.net/pictures-and-photography/)\
i mentioned i may one day get a camera of my own?

well, it happened.

i got a minolta x-570, a camera made in 1983\
as a low-cost alternative to the x-700.

it is revered for its strictly manual capabilities\
and its good-for-its-time functioning lightmeter.

i've shot three rolls now, one of portra 800,\
one of kodak gold 200, and another of kodak ultramax 400.

i'm looking forward to taking more pictures\
and learning more about adobe lightroom and editing as i go.

i'm sure at some point, at this rate,\
i'll end up buying a digital camera as well..

thanks for reading today's post.\
please keep my wallet in your thoughts and prayers.
